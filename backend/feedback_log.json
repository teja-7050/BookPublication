The text is displayed within a digital interface that includes standard navigational and display tools, followed by the literary content, and concluding with page metadata and licensing information.\n\n**I.

Navigational links specific to the book structure are provided for \"Book 1\" and \"Chapter 2.\"\n\n**II. Literary Content: \"The Gates of Morning\" - Book 1, Chapter 1: \"The Canoe Builder\"**\n\nThis chapter introduces Dick, a central character, as he stands on a coral ledge, surveying the tranquil lagoon of Karolin. He perceives himself as the new leader of the island's community\u2014comprising women, children, and youths\u2014who were left vulnerable after their men were lost to war.\n\nDick's past is largely obscured by a \"luminous haze,\" with memories beginning distinctly only with the arrival of Katafa, a girl previously blown out to sea, who became his companion. He was raised on a distant island, Palm Tree (Marua), by an old sailor named Kearney, learning survival skills. Dick (known as Taori by the islanders) and Katafa eventually escaped Palm Tree due to an invasion by \"bad men\" (Melanesians) who violently took over the island and destroyed their ship. They sought refuge in Karolin, guided by the lagoon's light.\n\nA child, Tari, questions Dick's identity, prompting a reflection on Dick's forgotten past and his present role as the community's divinely appointed chief. Dick's mind is burdened by the imminent threat from the Melanesians on Palm Tree. Although currently lacking canoes, Dick anticipates their eventual arrival, having observed the same lagoon light that guided him. Recognizing this danger, Dick initiates strategic preparations, dispatching a canoe to retrieve three elderly, experienced canoe-builders: Aioma, Palia, and Tafata. His resolve is further intensified by his deep affection for Katafa, whom he feels compelled to protect.\n\nAs Dick contemplates the north, Katafa joins him, pointing towards the sea. Through a mirage, Palm Tree becomes visible, reinforcing the vivid and traumatic memory of their escape. The sight of the island, though beautiful, signifies an ongoing threat from the \"demons\" inhabiting it. Dick's gaze hardens with resolve and hatred for those who threatened Katafa. He understands that the Melanesians, driven by their need for women and resources, will inevitably seek out Karolin.\n\nThe narrative concludes with the fading mirage of Palm Tree and the arrival of the canoe carrying the requested canoe-builders, indicating Dick's immediate step in preparing for the anticipated conflict. The chapter underscores the foundational human instinct for war, rapine, and destruction, suggesting that danger extends beyond specific groups to the broader \"wolves of civilization\" across the vast ocean.\n\n**III.

Before him stretched the Karolin lagoon, a tranquil expanse of water resembling a lake. Infinite, blue, and teeming with fishing gulls, it was enclosed by a forty-mile ring of coral, effectively making it a sea within a sea. Capable of violent storms in heavy winds, yet a lake of azure in light airs, it was now under his de facto dominion, a day after his arrival.\n\nWomen, children, and youths populated the beach, engaged in fishing with nets, playing games, or tending to the paraka patches. They were now his people. The canoes resting on the sand were his, as were the empty houses that once housed the war canoes on their rollers.\n\nHowever, as his gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, his brow furrowed. Turning his back on the lagoon, he faced the breakers and the northern sea. Far beyond the sea line lay Palm Tree, an island of captivating beauty, yet teeming with potential adversaries.\n\nLittle Tari, son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat nearby on the coral and looked up at him. Though young, Tari understood that war had swept away the men of Karolin, leaving the women, boys, and children vulnerable and without leadership.\n\nThen, the previous day, from the northern sea, a strange boat arrived carrying a new figure and Katafa, the girl who had been lost at sea years prior. The women hailed him as Taori, sent by the gods to be their chief and ruler.\n\nUnconcerned with the nature of the gods, the child, now alone with this remarkable individual and out of earshot of his mother, directly inquired, \"Taori, who are you?\"\n\nHad Dick been able to articulate his past, would the child have comprehended the tale? \"Tari, I come from beyond your world. My name is Dick Lestrange, and when I was younger than you, I was left with an old sailor named Kearney on that island you call Marua (Palm Tree). There we lived, and Kearney taught me to fish and spear fish, crafting toy ships for me. Then, one day, Katafa, lost from here in a storm, arrived. She lived with us until Kearney's death, after which we were alone. She taught me her language, the language of Karolin, and named me Taori. We loved each other and could have lived forever on Marua, but a ship arrived filled with malicious men from the eastern islands of Melanesia. They killed the white men with them, burned the ship, and we escaped in our boat, taking our belongings, including the toy ships, and navigated towards Karolin, guided by the lagoon light in the sky.\"\n\nHowever, he could not fully convey this to Tari, as the name Dick had faded from his memory, along with the language he had spoken as a child. Kearney, his guardian, was almost forgotten, obscured by the luminous haze of his past.\n\nFor those long shipwrecked and isolated, the past becomes blurred. For Dick, it began with Katafa's arrival on Marua, the prior events consumed by the tropic light, the storms, and the rainy seasons. Only the toy ships crafted by Kearney remained as a tangible link to his former self.\n\nHe looked at the inquisitive child and answered, \"I am Taori, Tari. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" the child replied. \"I ask as I breathe, but adults never answer the questions of Tari. Ah, the fish!\" His attention shifted to the children hauling in a net, and he ran off.\n\nDick turned his gaze north again. The child's question had stirred his mind, and he saw the schooner that had landed on Palm Tree only to be burned by the Melanesians. He recalled Katafa and himself escaping in Kearney's old dinghy, their arrival on this beach, and the welcoming women and children, considering him a leader sent by the gods.\n\nThen, as he gazed northward, the memory of those from whom he had escaped tainted the beauty of the sea and sky.\n\nThere was no immediate danger from those who had taken Palm Tree. The men of Palm Tree possessed no canoes, but they would undoubtedly build them and, as surely as he had, they would see the distant reflection of Karolin lagoon in the sky. It might take time, but they would come.\n\nDick, a man acclimated to his surroundings, retained the white man's capacity for foresight and imagination.\n\nThat morning, he had dispatched a canoe to the southern beach to retrieve Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, three elders expert in canoe construction. Gazing at the tribe, he saw a hundred youths approaching the age of warfare. However, beneath it all, fueled by his love for Katafa, his other half, lay the resolve to protect her from any threat, however vague.\n\nWar canoes! Would he fight the invaders in the lagoon or as they approached the shore? Or did he intend to preemptively strike, eliminating the threat before it materialized? The answer remained uncertain.\n\nA hand fell upon his shoulder. Turning, he faced Katafa, a strand of her dark hair escaping the vine that bound it, her luminous eyes fixed on the point he had been gazing at - the northern sea line.\n\n\"Look!\" Katafa exclaimed.\n\nUnder specific weather conditions, Palm Tree became visible from Karolin through mirage. They had seen it the previous evening, and now it was returning, a mysterious stain low in the southern sky, deepening and solidifying until the island materialized, diaphanous yet vivid.\n\nHand on his shoulder, they stood silently, their untutored minds ignorant of mirage, their eyes fixed on the place from which they had escaped, rising from beyond the sea line as if to observe them.\n\nThey relived the scene: the horde of savages on the beach, monstrous figures from a nightmare, the wind filling the sail as the dinghy raced for safety, the yells of the Melanesians, crazed from stolen rum. Before them lay the scene of the tragedy, the lovely picture obscuring the demons that inhabited it.\n\nAs Dick gazed at this dangerous beauty, his nostrils flared, and his eyes darkened with hate. They had threatened him; but they threatened Katafa, and that was everything.\n\nSomeday, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to confirm his instincts. They would build canoes and, seeing the lagoon light in the sky, they would come. They were without women and he instinctly felt as he was drawn to Katafa so would those men be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon in search of some island whose tribe might be raided of its women and seeing the lagoon light they would come.\n\nDanger lay not only to the north, but wherever greed, desire, or hatred roamed on that sea, not only amongst savages, but the wolves of civilization.\n\nDick's world was confined to the waters surrounding the islands. He knew nothing of Europe, America, or history beyond his own brief life with Katafa. Yet, even in that short time, he had learned to dread men and grasped the essence of history: man's instinct for war, rapine, and destruction.\n\nThen, the vision of Palm Tree faded, and Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the southern beach.\n\nIt was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they descended to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.\n",

The relentless breakers of the outer sea crashed behind him, scattering spindrift on the wind. Before him lay the lagoon of Karolin, an ocean as placid as a lake, infinite and blue, frequented by fishing gulls. This vast expanse, enclosed by its forty-mile coral ring, was a self-contained sea, prone to violent storms in high winds yet a lake of azure in gentle breezes. It was *his* \u2013 this domain he had claimed only the day before.\n\nWomen, children, and youths, all members of the tribe, were visible along the beach, actively engaged in fishing with nets, playing games, or tending the paraka patches. They were his people. The canoes drawn up on the sand were his, as were the empty houses where war canoes once rested on rollers.\n\nHowever, as his gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, his brow furrowed. Turning his back to the tranquil lagoon, he faced the breakers of the outer beach and the northern sea. Far beyond the horizon lay Palm Tree Island, an island beautiful as a dream yet teeming with menace.\n\nLittle Tari, son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat nearby on the coral, observing him. Tari, though young, understood that the tribe had been left vulnerable, bereft of men and leadership, by the war that had swept away the men of Karolin. Then, yesterday, this unfamiliar figure had arrived from the northern sea in a strange vessel, accompanied by Katafa, the girl who had been lost at sea years prior. The women declared he had been sent by the gods to be their chief and ruler.\n\nUnconcerned with the nature of the gods, the child, now alone with this intriguing newcomer and beyond the hearing of his mother, posed a direct question with childlike simplicity: \u201cTaori,\u201d said little Tari, \u201cwho are you?\u201d\n\nCould Dick have truly answered, would the child have grasped the strange narrative he might have shared? \"Tari, I hail from a world beyond your understanding. My name is Dick Lestrange, and when I was smaller than you, I was abandoned on that island you call Marua (Palm Tree), fifty miles to the north, with an old sailor named Kearney. We lived there as I grew to be a boy. Kearney taught me to fish and spear, and he fashioned toys for me, little ships unlike the canoes of these islands. Then, Tari, years ago, Katafa arrived, the girl who had been swept away from here in a storm. She lived with us until Kearney passed, leaving us alone. She taught me her language, the language of Karolin. She named me Taori. We loved one another and might have remained forever on Marua, but a large ship arrived, filled with dangerous men from the eastern islands of Melanesia. They came to fell trees, then they murdered the white men with them, burned the ship, and we escaped in our boat, carrying all that we held dear, even the little ships, steering for Karolin, guided by the reflected lagoon light in the sky.\"\n\nBut he could not articulate this to Tari, at least not in its entirety. The very name of Dick had faded from his memory, along with the language he had spoken as a child. Kearney, the sailor who had raised him, was almost forgotten, obscured by the luminous haze of his past.\n\nFor men long shipwrecked and isolated, the past becomes blurred and indistinct. For Dick, it began only with Katafa's arrival on Marua; prior to that, all was forgotten, as if consumed by the blazing tropic light that bathed the island and the sea, the relentless storms that lashed the coconut groves, and the dense mists of the rainy seasons. Kearney would have been entirely forgotten were it not for the little ships he had crafted as playthings for the boy \u2013 now a man.\n\nHe looked down at the inquisitive child. \"I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know,\u201d the child replied. \u201cI ask as I breathe, but no adults \u2013 *madyana* \u2013 ever answer the questions of Tari. Ah, the fish!\" His attention had already wandered, drawn by the shouts of children hauling in a net, and he scampered away.\n\nDick turned his gaze northward once more. The child's question had stirred his mind, evoking the image of the schooner that had docked at Palm Tree, only to be burned by the Melanesian hands. He saw again Katafa and himself escaping in the old dinghy that Kearney had taught him to handle. He envisioned their landing on this beach the previous day, and the women and children surrounding him, viewing him as a divine emissary sent to be their chief and leader.\n\nAs he stared towards the north, the memory of the men from whom he and Katafa had fled tainted the beauty of the sea and sky.\n\nThere was no immediate threat from the men who had seized Palm Tree; they possessed no canoes. But they would undoubtedly construct canoes, and they would surely observe the far-off mirrored blaze of Karolin lagoon in the sky, as he had. And they would come. It might take a considerable time, but they would come.\n\nDick was nearly a *blook*, a *kanaka*, a savage. And yet, the white man remained within him. He could reason, contemplate a problem from all angles, and imagine.\n\nThat was why he had dispatched a canoe that morning to the southern beach, to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata \u2013 three elderly men, too old for war, but skilled canoe builders. That was also why, upon surveying the tribe, he was encouraged by the sight of nearly a hundred youths nearing fighting age. But above all else, driving him and fueling his determination to achieve great things, was his profound love for Katafa, his other half, more precious than himself, threatened, however vaguely, yet undeniably threatened.\n\nWar canoes! Did he intend to defend the lagoon, engage the invaders as they approached the shore, or perhaps proactively attack the source of the threat before it could escalate? Only time would tell.\n\nA hand touched his shoulder, and he turned to face Katafa. A stray lock of her dark hair, escaping the vine that bound it, blew backward in the breeze like an eagle's feather. Her luminous, dark eyes, instead of meeting his, were fixed on the due-north sea line, the point he had been staring at.\n\n\"Look!\" Katafa exclaimed.\n\nUnder certain weather conditions, Palm Tree, though far beyond the horizon, became visible from Karolin through mirage. They had seen it the previous evening, and now it was beginning to materialize again, to bloom, to come to life \u2013 a mysterious stain low in the southern sky, a dull spot in the dazzling sea, gradually deepening and solidifying as if sketched by an unseen artist. The island appeared beautiful as a dream, diaphanous yet vivid.\n\nWith her hand on his shoulder, they stood in silence, their minds unrefined, ignorant of mirage, their gazes fixed on the place from which they had escaped, now rising so strangely beyond the distant horizon as if to observe them.\n\nThey saw again the horde of savages on the beach, figures as monstrous as the forms in a nightmare. They felt again the wind filling the sail as the dinghy raced for safety and the open sea. They heard again the shouts of the Melanesians, crazed with rum stolen from the schooner they had brought in, which they had subsequently burned. And there, before them, lay the scene of the tragedy, a lovely picture that betrayed nothing of the demons that still inhabited it.\n\nAs Dick gazed upon this loveliness, which was simultaneously a threat and a warning, his nostrils flared, and his eyes grew dark with hate. They had threatened him \u2013 that was inconsequential. They had threatened Katafa \u2013 that was everything. And they *still* threatened her.\n\nSomeday, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to echo what instinct already told him. They would build canoes, and, seeing the reflected lagoon light in the sky, they would come. Those men were without women, and here there were women. Instinct whispered that just as he had been drawn to Katafa, so too would these men be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon in search of some island whose tribe might be raided for its women. And, seeing the lagoon light, they would come.\n\nIf only he knew, danger lay not only to the north, but wherever greed, desire, or hatred might roam on that azure sea, not only among savages, but among the wolves of civilization.\n\nFor Dick, the world extended no further than the water that encircled the two islands; there was no Europe, no America, no history but the history of his brief life and that of Katafa. And yet, even in that short life, he had learned to dread men and had glimpsed the foundation of all history \u2013 man\u2019s instinct for war, rapine, and destruction.\n\nGradually, the vision of Palm Tree began to fade and disappear, vanishing suddenly like a light extinguished. As they turned from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the southern beach.\n\nIt was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they descended to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.\n",

This vast, coral-encircled lagoon, a sea unto itself, had become his domain a mere day after his arrival.\n\nThe women, children, and youths of the tribe populated the beach, engaged in fishing, games, or tending to the *paraka* patches. All were now under his stewardship, as were the canoes lining the sand and the vacant houses that once sheltered war canoes.\n\nHowever, as his gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, his brow furrowed. Turning his back to the calm water, he faced the breakers of the outer beach and the northern sea. Beyond the horizon, obscured from view, lay Palm Tree, an island of deceptive beauty, yet teeming with peril.\n\nLittle Tari, son of the net maker Le Taioi, sat nearby on the coral and observed him. Though young and inexperienced, Tari understood that the war-driven absence of Karolin's men had left the remaining inhabitants vulnerable and without leadership. Only yesterday, a stranger, accompanied by Katafa, a young woman lost at sea years prior, had arrived from the northern sea in an unfamiliar vessel. The women declared that the gods had sent him to be their chief and ruler.\n\nWith the earnest curiosity of a child, Tari, emboldened by his solitude with this new figure, asked directly, \"Taori, who are you?\"\n\nCould Dick have conveyed the intricate details of his past, would Tari have even understood? He might have begun, \"Tari, I originate from beyond this world. My name is Dick Lestrange, and I spent my early years on the island you call Marua (Palm Tree), fifty miles to the north, with an old sailor named Kearney. He taught me to fish and to craft, creating miniature ships unlike the island's canoes. Then, one day, Katafa, who had been swept away from Karolin, joined us. After Kearney's death, we remained alone together. Katafa taught me her language, and we grew to love each other. We might have remained at Marua indefinitely had a ship not arrived, carrying treacherous men from the eastern islands of Melanesia. They murdered the white men accompanying them, set the ship ablaze, and we were forced to flee in our boat, taking our most cherished possessions, including the little ships. Guided by the lagoon light, we sailed to Karolin.\"\n\nHowever, Dick found himself unable to articulate this narrative, or even fully recall it. The name \"Dick\" had faded from his memory, along with the language of his childhood. Kearney, the sailor who had raised him, was a distant memory, obscured by the tropical haze that enveloped his past. The past, for those long lost and shipwrecked, often becomes indistinct. For Dick, his true life began only with Katafa's arrival on Marua. The past, beyond that point, had been consumed by the tropic light, the storms, and the rainy seasons. Kearney's memory lingered only through the miniature ships he had fashioned as playthings for the boy who now stood before him as a man.\n\nHe looked down at the child. \"I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" the child replied. \"I ask as I breathe. But the elders never answer my questions... Ah, the fish!\" His attention diverted, he turned towards the shouts of children hauling in a net and darted away.\n\nDick refocused his gaze northward. Tari's question had stirred dormant memories. He recalled the schooner that had docked at Palm Tree, only to be consumed by the Melanesians. He saw Katafa and himself escaping in the dinghy that Kearney had taught him to navigate. He remembered their arrival on this beach yesterday, and the throngs of women and children who greeted him as their divinely appointed leader.\n\nAs he continued to gaze towards the north, the memory of those he had fled from tainted the beauty of the sea and sky. While there was no immediate threat from the men who now occupied Palm Tree, they would inevitably build canoes. They would undoubtedly see the mirror-like reflection of Karolin's lagoon in the sky, as he had done. And they would come, eventually.\n\nDick, though seemingly a \"kanaka,\" a savage, retained the capacity for foresight and strategic thinking.\n\nThat was why, earlier that morning, he had dispatched a canoe to the southern beach to retrieve Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, three elders renowned for their canoe-building expertise. He had noted that nearly a hundred of the island's youths were approaching martial age. But above all else, driving his thoughts and inspiring his actions, was his deep affection for Katafa, his confidante and partner, whose safety was paramount.\n\nWhat were his plans for war canoes? Did he intend to defend the lagoon against invaders, or would he launch a preemptive strike, eliminating the danger at its source? Only time would tell.\n\nA hand rested upon his shoulder. He turned to face Katafa. A strand of her dark hair, escaping the vine that bound it, danced in the breeze like an eagle's feather. Her luminous eyes, instead of meeting his, were fixed upon the distant, due-north sea line.\n\n\"Look!\" Katafa exclaimed.\n\nUnder specific atmospheric conditions, Palm Tree, though beyond the horizon, became visible from Karolin through mirage. They had seen it the previous evening, and now it was beginning to materialize once more. A mysterious stain in the southern sky, a faint blemish in the sea's reflection, gradually deepened and solidified until, as if drawn by an invisible hand, the island appeared, ethereal yet vivid.\n\nWith her hand upon his shoulder, they stood silently, their minds unversed in the science of mirage, their gaze transfixed upon the place from which they had escaped.\n\nThey again imagined the savage horde on the beach, their forms magnified into nightmares, they relived the wind that swelled the sail of the dinghy as it raced towards the open sea, and they heard the shrieks of the Melanesians, fuelled by rum stolen from the burned schooner. The scene of that tragedy played out before them, a deceptive image of beauty masking the terrors within.\n\nAs Dick gazed upon this vision, both alluring and menacing, his nostrils flared and his eyes darkened with anger. The Melanesians had threatened him, but more significantly, they had threatened Katafa, and they continued to pose a threat.\n\nSomeday, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to echo the warning that instinct had whispered. They would build canoes, and drawn by the lagoon's light, they would seek out a new home. Lacking women of their own, these men would be drawn to the women of Karolin.\n\nDanger lurked not only to the north, but wherever greed, desire, or malice might roam upon that azure sea, from both savages and the wolves of civilization.\n\nDick's world was confined to the waters surrounding the two islands. He had no knowledge of Europe, America, or any history beyond his brief life and that of Katafa. Yet, even in that short span, he had learned to fear men and to recognize the primal drives of war, pillage, and destruction.\n\nGradually, the mirage of Palm Tree began to fade and disappear. As they turned away from the sea towards the lagoon, Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the southern beach.\n\nIt was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they walked down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.\n\n**References:**\n\n*   [1]\n*   [2]\n*   [3]\n*   [4]\n*   [5]\n*   [6]\n*   [7]\n\n**Footer:**\n*   [Back to Top](#top)\n*   [Next Chapter](#next)\n\n***\n\nThis version aims to be more professional by:\n\n*   **Removing extraneous \"Jump to content\" and navigation elements.**  Focuses only on the chapter content.\n*   **Creating a clear chapter title.**\n*   **Structuring the text in paragraphs.**\n*   **Reframing informal language.** Replacing language like \"Jump to content\" and \"Main menu\" with more professional terms like \"Navigation\".\n*   **Replacing \"Then\" statements.** In many cases it creates more flow and readability by removing \"Then\" from the beginning of the sentence.\n*   **Removing unnecessary repetition:** For instance, cutting the \"Chapter 2\" link at the bottom as it's already stated at the top.\n*   **Removing the historical Wiki notice and linking.** This is unnecessary for a rewrite intended to be read on its own.\n*   **Keeping the overall tone more serious and focused on the content.**\n*   **Using descriptive language** Adding descriptive language like, \"canoe-building expertise,\" \"the primal drives of war, pillage, and destruction,\" and \"the island's youths were approaching martial age.\"\n",

    "spun_text": "## Rewritten Text (Professional Tone)\n\n**Chapter I: The Canoe Builder**\n\nDick Lestrange, positioned on a coral ledge, surveyed the southern horizon. Behind him, the outer ocean's breakers crashed, scattering spindrift on the wind. Before him lay the Karolin lagoon: a tranquil expanse, as smooth as a lake, infinite in its blueness, and frequented by fishing gulls. Enclosed by its forty-mile coral reef, this vast body of water was a self-contained sea, prone to storms in heavy winds but transformed into an azure lake in gentle breezes. It was his domain, claimed only the previous day.\n\nWomen, children, and youths populated the beach under the blazing sun, engaged in fishing with nets, playing games, or tending to the paraka patches. All were his people. The canoes resting on the sand and the vacant houses that once housed the war canoes were his responsibility.\n\nAs his gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, his brow furrowed. Turning his back to the lagoon, he faced the breakers on the outer beach and the northern sea. Beyond the horizon, lay Palm Tree, an island of captivating beauty, yet, reputedly, swarming with danger.\n\nNearby, Little Tari, son of Le Taioi the net maker, looked up at him. Tari, inexperienced in life, understood that the loss of Karolin's men in war had left the women, boys, and children vulnerable, without a male leader. The previous day, a stranger had arrived from the northern sea in an unfamiliar vessel, accompanied by Katafa, a woman who had been lost at sea years prior while fishing. The women declared that this newcomer had been sent by the gods to be their chief and ruler.\n\nThe child, unconcerned with the nature of deities, and finding himself alone with this intriguing figure, seized the opportunity, out of earshot of his mother, to pose a direct question with childlike simplicity.\n\n\"Taori,\" Little Tari inquired, \"who are you?\"\n\nHad Dick possessed the capacity to answer fully, it is doubtful the child could have comprehended the complex narrative Dick might have related. \"Tari, I hail from a world beyond your knowledge. My name is Dick Lestrange, and when I was younger than you, I was left on the island you call Marua (Palm Tree), fifty miles to the north, with an old sailor. There we lived, and there I grew. Kearney, as he was named, taught me to fish and spear fish, and he crafted toys for me, miniature ships unlike the island canoes. Then, years ago, Katafa, the girl who had been swept away from here in a storm, arrived. She lived with us until Kearney passed away, leaving us alone. She taught me her language, the language of Karolin. She named me Taori. We cherished each other and might have remained at Marua indefinitely, were it not for the arrival of a large vessel filled with hostile men from the eastern islands of Melanesia. They had come to harvest trees, but they mutinied, murdered the white men, and set fire to the ship. We escaped in our boat, taking with us our possessions, including the miniature ships, and guided by the lagoon light in the sky, we sailed for Karolin.\"\n\nHowever, he could not articulate this narrative entirely to Tari, as the very name of Dick had faded from his memory, along with the language he had spoken as a child. Kearney, the sailor who had raised him, was all but forgotten, obscured by the luminous haze of his past.\n\nFor individuals long shipwrecked and isolated, the past becomes blurred and indistinct. For Dick, his past began only with Katafa's arrival on Marua. Prior to that, everything was forgotten, consumed by the intense tropical light that bathed the island and the sea, the violent storms that swept through the coconut groves, and the heavy rains of the rainy seasons. Kearney would have been completely forgotten were it not for the small ships he had made as toys for the boy, who was now a man.\n\nHe looked down at the questioning child. \u201cI am Taori, Tari tatu, why do you ask?\u201d\n\n\"I do not know,\" the child replied. \"I ask as I breathe, but no adults \u2013 madyana \u2013 ever answer my questions. Ai, the fish!\" His attention diverted by the cries of other children hauling in a net, he abandoned the subject and ran off.\n\nDick turned his gaze north again. The child's question had stirred his mind, and he recalled the schooner that had docked at Palm Tree, only to be burned by the Melanesian crew. He saw himself and Katafa making their escape in the old dinghy Kearney had taught him to handle. He remembered their arrival on this beach the day before, and the welcoming crowd of women and children, who regarded him as a leader sent by the gods.\n\nAs he gazed towards the north, the memory of the men from whom he and Katafa had fled tainted the beauty of the sea and sky.\n\nThere was no immediate threat from the men who had seized Palm Tree. They had no canoes, but they would undoubtedly build them. They would surely see the distant reflection of Karolin's lagoon in the sky, as he had seen it, and they would come. It might take time, but they would come.\n\nDick was now almost entirely a *kanaka*, a native, a *savage*, and yet the white man remained within him. He could think strategically, comprehensively, and imaginatively.\n\nThat morning, he had dispatched a canoe to the southern beach to summon Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, three elders, too old for war but skilled canoe builders. He had also observed with renewed hope that nearly a hundred of the youths were approaching the age of military readiness. Above all else, fueling his mind and inspiring daring, was his devotion to Katafa, his other self, more precious to him than his own life, and vaguely yet undeniably threatened.\n\nWar canoes! Did he intend to confront the invaders in the lagoon or as they approached the shore, or did he harbor a desire to strike first, eliminating the threat at its source? Who knew?\n\nA hand fell upon his shoulder. Turning, he faced Katafa. A lock of her dark hair, escaped from the vine securing it, blew backward on the breeze, like an eagle\u2019s feather. Her luminous, dark eyes, instead of meeting his, were fixed on the northern horizon.\n\n\"Look!\" Katafa exclaimed.\n\nUnder certain weather conditions, Palm Tree, though beyond the horizon, became visible from Karolin through a mirage. They had seen it the previous evening, and now it was beginning to emerge again, to take shape, to come to life. A mysterious stain low in the southern sky, a faint blemish in the sea's dazzling surface, gradually deepened and solidified, until the island, as if sketched by an invisible hand, appeared, beautiful as a dream, diaphanous yet vivid.\n\nHand on his shoulder, they stood in silence, their minds untutored in the intricacies of mirage, their eyes fixed on the place from which they had escaped, now strangely rising beyond the horizon, as if to observe them.\n\nThey relived the sight of the horde of savages on the beach, figures monstrous as nightmares, and recalled the wind that filled their sail as the dinghy raced for safety out to sea. They heard again the yells of the Melanesians, intoxicated by rum stolen from the schooner they had seized and burned. There, before them, lay the scene of the tragedy, a captivating vision that concealed the demons that still inhabited it.\n\nAs Dick gazed upon this beauty, which was also a threat and a warning, his nostrils flared and his eyes darkened with hate. They had threatened him \u2013 that was inconsequential; they had threatened Katafa \u2013 that was everything, and they still threatened her.\n\nSome day they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to echo his instinct. They would build canoes, and, seeing the lagoon's reflection in the sky, they would come. They were without women, those men, and here were women. He had been drawn to Katafa, and instinct half whispered that these men would be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon for an island ripe for raiding, and seeing the lagoon light, they would come.\n\nDanger lay not only to the north, but wherever greed, desire, or hatred might roam on that azure sea, not only amongst savages, but amongst the wolves of civilization.\n\nFor Dick, the world was confined to the two islands surrounded by water. He knew nothing of Europe, America, or history, save for the history of his and Katafa's short lives. Yet, even in that brief time, he had learned to fear men and had glimpsed the foundations of all history: man's instinct for war, rapine, and destruction.\n\nGradually, the vision of Palm Tree began to fade and disappear. As they turned from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the southern beach.\n\nIt was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they walked down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.\n",

Behind him, the outer sea's breakers thundered, scattering spindrift on the wind. Before him lay the Karolin lagoon, a tranquil ocean mirroring the sky \u2013 an endless expanse of blue, frequented by fishing gulls.\n\nEnclosed by its forty-mile coral ring, this vast body of water was a sea unto itself, subject to storms in heavy winds and a lake of azure in light airs. It was his, claimed by right of his arrival only the day before.\n\nWomen, children, and youths populated the beach under the blazing sun, engaged in fishing with nets, playing, or tending to the paraka patches. All were his people. The canoes drawn up on the sand were his, as were the empty houses where war canoes once rested on rollers.\n\nHis gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, and his brow furrowed. Turning from the lagoon, he faced the breakers and the northern sea. Far beyond the horizon lay Palm Tree, an island of exquisite beauty, yet teeming with latent threat.\n\nLittle Tari, son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat nearby on the coral, observing him. Tari possessed limited worldly experience but understood that the men of Karolin, lost to war, had left the women, boys, and children vulnerable and without leadership.\n\nThe previous day, a stranger arrived from the northern sea in an unfamiliar vessel, accompanied by Katafa, a girl blown out to sea years prior during a fishing trip. The women proclaimed this new figure a divine emissary, sent to be their chief and ruler.\n\nThe child understood little of the gods, but undeterred and now alone with this remarkable stranger, beyond his mother's earshot, he posed his query with childlike directness.\n\n\"Taori,\" Little Tari asked, \"who are you?\" (\u00e9 kamina tai)\n\nCould Dick have articulated the answer, would the child have comprehended the tale he might have told? \"Tari, I come from a place beyond your understanding. My name is Dick Lestrange, and when I was younger than you, I was left with an old sailor on the island you call Marua (Palm Tree), fifty miles to the north. We lived there, and I grew under Kearney's tutelage. He taught me to fish and spear, and he crafted playthings for me \u2013 small ships unlike the island canoes. Then, Tari, Katafa, the girl lost in the storm, arrived. She lived with us until Kearney's death, after which we were alone. She taught me her language, the language of Karolin. She named me Taori. We loved one another and might have remained at Marua forever, had not a ship arrived, filled with treacherous men from the eastern islands of Melanesia. They came to fell trees, then rose in mutiny, killing the white men and setting fire to the ship. We escaped in our boat, taking all we cherished, including the little ships, and guided by the lagoon light, sailed for Karolin.\"\n\nBut Dick could not convey this narrative fully, for the name Dick had faded from his memory, along with the language of his childhood. Kearney, his guardian, was a dim figure in the luminous haze of his past.\n\nFor the long-shipwrecked and isolated, the past becomes blurred. Dick's memory began with Katafa's arrival at Marua; all before was obscured, as if consumed by the tropical light, the storms that swept the coconut groves, the mists of the rainy seasons. Kearney would have been forgotten entirely, were it not for the small ships he had fashioned for the boy, who was now a man.\n\nHe regarded the inquisitive child. \"I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" the child replied. \"I ask as I breathe, but the elders \u2013 madyana \u2013 never answer Tari's questions. Ai, the fish!\" His fleeting attention was drawn to the shouts of children hauling in a net, and he ran off.\n\nDick returned his gaze to the north. The child's question had stirred his thoughts, and he again envisioned the schooner that had called at Palm Tree, only to be burned by the Melanesians. He saw Katafa and himself escaping in the old dinghy Kearney had taught him to handle. He relived their arrival on this beach, the swarm of women and children hailing him as their divinely appointed chief.\n\nAs he gazed northwards, the memory of the men from whom he and Katafa had fled tainted the beauty of the sea and sky.\n\nThere was no immediate threat from the men occupying Palm Tree; they possessed no canoes. But they would build canoes \u2013 surely they would. And equally surely, they would see the distant, reflected blaze of the Karolin lagoon, just as he had, and they would come. It might take a long time, but they would come.\n\nDick was nearly a local, a Kanaka, a savage; yet the European remained within him. He could strategize, analyze, and anticipate.\n\nThat morning, he had dispatched a canoe to the southern beach to retrieve Aioma, Palia, and Tafata \u2013 three elders, past fighting age, but skilled canoe builders. Gazing at the gathered tribe, he had observed that nearly a hundred youths were approaching military age. Beneath it all, igniting his mind, soared his passion for Katafa, his other self, more precious than his own life, threatened, however faintly.\n\nWar canoes! Did he plan to fight the invaders in the lagoon or as they approached the shore, or did he intend to strike preemptively at the source of the threat? Only time would tell.\n\nA hand rested on his shoulder, and he turned to face Katafa. A strand of her dark hair, escaping the vine that bound it, blew in the breeze like an eagle's feather. Her luminous, dark eyes were fixed on the point to which he had been gazing \u2013 the northern horizon.\n\n\"Look!\" Katafa exclaimed.\n\nUnder specific weather conditions, Palm Tree, though beyond the horizon, could be seen from Karolin through a mirage. They had seen it the previous evening, and now it was beginning to reappear, to take shape \u2013 a mysterious stain low on the horizon, a dark spot in the sea's dazzle, deepening and hardening until, as if sketched by an unseen hand, the island emerged in dreamlike beauty, diaphanous yet vivid.\n\nHand on his shoulder, they stood in silence, uneducated and unfamiliar with mirages, their eyes fixed on the place from which they had escaped, now rising so strangely beyond the sea line as if to observe them.\n\nThey relived the sight of the savages on the beach, figures as monstrous as those in a nightmare. They felt the wind that had filled the sail as the dinghy raced for safety on the open sea, and they heard the shouts of the Melanesians, crazed with rum stolen from the ship they had burned. And there, before them, lay the scene of the tragedy, a beautiful image that concealed the demons that still inhabited it.\n\nAs Dick gazed at this loveliness, this threat, his nostrils flared, and his eyes darkened with hatred. The threat to him meant little, but the threat to Katafa meant everything.\n\nSomeday, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to echo this instinct. They would build canoes, see the lagoon light reflected in the sky, and come. They were without women, and here were women. Instinct whispered that, just as he had been drawn to Katafa, these men would be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon for an island whose women could be taken, and seeing the lagoon light, they would come.\n\nDanger lay not only to the north, but wherever greed, desire, or hatred might roam on the azure sea; not only among savages, but among the wolves of civilization.\n\nFor Dick, there was no world beyond the waters surrounding the two islands; no Europe, no America, no history but the history of his short life and Katafa's. Yet even in that brief span, he had learned to fear men and had glimpsed the essence of all history \u2013 man's instinct for war, rapine, and destruction.\n\nGradually, the vision of Palm Tree began to fade, vanishing suddenly as if extinguished. As they turned from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the southern beach.\n\nIt was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders.

Behind him, the outer sea's breakers thundered, scattering spindrift on the wind. Before him lay the Karolin lagoon, a tranquil ocean mirroring the sky \u2013 an endless expanse of blue, frequented by fishing gulls.\n\nEnclosed by its forty-mile coral ring, this vast body of water was a sea unto itself, subject to storms in heavy winds and a lake of azure in light airs. It was his, claimed by right of his arrival only the day before.\n\nWomen, children, and youths populated the beach under the blazing sun, engaged in fishing with nets, playing, or tending to the paraka patches. All were his people. The canoes drawn up on the sand were his, as were the empty houses where war canoes once rested on rollers.\n\nHis gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, and his brow furrowed. Turning from the lagoon, he faced the breakers and the northern sea. Far beyond the horizon lay Palm Tree, an island of exquisite beauty, yet teeming with latent threat.\n\nLittle Tari, son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat nearby on the coral, observing him. Tari possessed limited worldly experience but understood that the men of Karolin, lost to war, had left the women, boys, and children vulnerable and without leadership.\n\nThe previous day, a stranger arrived from the northern sea in an unfamiliar vessel, accompanied by Katafa, a girl blown out to sea years prior during a fishing trip. The women proclaimed this new figure a divine emissary, sent to be their chief and ruler.\n\nThe child understood little of the gods, but undeterred and now alone with this remarkable stranger, beyond his mother's earshot, he posed his query with childlike directness.\n\n\"Taori,\" Little Tari asked, \"who are you?\" (\u00e9 kamina tai)\n\nCould Teja have articulated the answer, would the child have comprehended the tale he might have told? \"Tari, I come from a place beyond your understanding. My name is Teja Lestrange, and when I was younger than you, I was left with an old sailor on the island you call Marua (Palm Tree), fifty miles to the north. We lived there, and I grew under Kearney's tutelage. He taught me to fish and spear, and he crafted playthings for me \u2013 small ships unlike the island canoes. Then, Tari, Katafa, the girl lost in the storm, arrived. She lived with us until Kearney's death, after which we were alone. She taught me her language, the language of Karolin. She named me Taori. We loved one another and might have remained at Marua forever, had not a ship arrived, filled with treacherous men from the eastern islands of Melanesia. They came to fell trees, then rose in mutiny, killing the white men and setting fire to the ship. We escaped in our boat, taking all we cherished, including the little ships, and guided by the lagoon light, sailed for Karolin.\"\n\nBut Teja could not convey this narrative fully, for the name Teja had faded from his memory, along with the language of his childhood. Kearney, his guardian, was a dim figure in the luminous haze of his past.\n\nFor the long-shipwrecked and isolated, the past becomes blurred. Teja's memory began with Katafa's arrival at Marua; all before was obscured, as if consumed by the tropical light, the storms that swept the coconut groves, the mists of the rainy seasons. Kearney would have been forgotten entirely, were it not for the small ships he had fashioned for the boy, who was now a man.\n\nHe regarded the inquisitive child. \"I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" the child replied. \"I ask as I breathe, but the elders \u2013 madyana \u2013 never answer Tari's questions. Ai, the fish!\" His fleeting attention was drawn to the shouts of children hauling in a net, and he ran off.\n\nTeja returned his gaze to the north. The child's question had stirred his thoughts, and he again envisioned the schooner that had called at Palm Tree, only to be burned by the Melanesians. He saw Katafa and himself escaping in the old dinghy Kearney had taught him to handle. He relived their arrival on this beach, the swarm of women and children hailing him as their divinely appointed chief.\n\nAs he gazed northwards, the memory of the men from whom he and Katafa had fled tainted the beauty of the sea and sky.\n\nThere was no immediate threat from the men occupying Palm Tree; they possessed no canoes. But they would build canoes \u2013 surely they would. And equally surely, they would see the distant, reflected blaze of the Karolin lagoon, just as he had, and they would come. It might take a long time, but they would come.\n\nTeja was nearly a local, a Kanaka, a savage; yet the European remained within him. He could strategize, analyze, and anticipate.\n\nThat morning, he had dispatched a canoe to the southern beach to retrieve Aioma, Palia, and Tafata \u2013 three elders, past fighting age, but skilled canoe builders. Gazing at the gathered tribe, he had observed that nearly a hundred youths were approaching military age. Beneath it all, igniting his mind, soared his passion for Katafa, his other self, more precious than his own life, threatened, however faintly.\n\nWar canoes! Did he plan to fight the invaders in the lagoon or as they approached the shore, or did he intend to strike preemptively at the source of the threat? Only time would tell.\n\nA hand rested on his shoulder, and he turned to face Katafa. A strand of her dark hair, escaping the vine that bound it, blew in the breeze like an eagle's feather. Her luminous, dark eyes were fixed on the point to which he had been gazing \u2013 the northern horizon.\n\n\"Look!\" Katafa exclaimed.\n\nUnder specific weather conditions, Palm Tree, though beyond the horizon, could be seen from Karolin through a mirage. They had seen it the previous evening, and now it was beginning to reappear, to take shape \u2013 a mysterious stain low on the horizon, a dark spot in the sea's dazzle, deepening and hardening until, as if sketched by an unseen hand, the island emerged in dreamlike beauty, diaphanous yet vivid.\n\nHand on his shoulder, they stood in silence, uneducated and unfamiliar with mirages, their eyes fixed on the place from which they had escaped, now rising so strangely beyond the sea line as if to observe them.\n\nThey relived the sight of the savages on the beach, figures as monstrous as those in a nightmare.

The breakers of the open sea crashed behind him, scattering spindrift on the wind. Before him lay the lagoon of Karolin, an ocean rendered calm as a lake, vast and blue, populated by fishing gulls. Enclosed within a forty-mile ring of coral, this expanse resembled a sea unto itself, capable of turbulent storms in heavy winds yet transforming into an azure lake in gentle breezes. It was now his, a realm he had claimed only the previous day.\n\nWomen, children, and youths populated the beach, engaged in various activities under the sun's intense gaze: fishing with nets, playing games, and tending to the paraka patches. All were now his people. The canoes drawn up on the sand were his, as were the empty houses where war canoes had once rested on rollers.\n\nAs his gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, a shadow crossed his brow. Turning his back to the lagoon, he faced the breakers on the outer beach and the northern sea. There, beyond the visible horizon, lay Palm Tree, an island of captivating beauty, yet teeming with unseen threats.\n\nLittle Tari, son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat nearby on the coral, observing him. Despite his youth, Tari understood that the loss of the men of Karolin in war had left the women, boys, and children defenseless, without a leader. Then, only yesterday, a stranger had arrived from the northern sea in an unfamiliar boat, accompanied by Katafa, the girl who had been lost at sea years prior. The women declared him sent by the gods to be their chief and ruler.\n\nThe child, unconcerned with the nature of gods, felt comfortable enough to ask the new figure a direct question, away from his mother's earshot.\n\n\"Taori,\" Tari asked, \"who are you?\" (\u00e9 kamina tai)\n\nCould Dick have provided an answer, would the child have understood the profound narrative Dick might have revealed? \"Tari, I hail from a world beyond your knowledge. My name is Dick Lestrange. Before I was even your age, I was left on the island you call Marua (Palm Tree) with an old sailor named Kearney. We lived there, and I grew into boyhood under his care. Kearney taught me to fish and hunt, and he crafted small toy ships for me, unlike the canoes of these islands. Then, long ago, Katafa, who had been swept away from Karolin in a storm, arrived. She lived with us until Kearney's passing, after which we were alone. She taught me her language, the language of Karolin. She named me Taori. We grew to love each other, and we could have lived forever on Marua had a ship not arrived, filled with dangerous men from the eastern islands of Melanesia. They had come to cut the trees, then they revolted, murdering the white men and burning the ship. We escaped in our boat, carrying everything we held dear, including the toy ships, and guided by the lagoon light in the sky, we sailed for Karolin.\"\n\nBut he could not fully articulate this to Tari. The very name of Dick had faded from his memory, along with the language of his childhood. Kearney, the sailor who had raised him, was nearly forgotten, obscured by the luminous haze of his past.\n\nFor men long shipwrecked and alone, the past becomes blurred and indistinct. For Dick, it began with Katafa's arrival on Marua; prior to that, all was lost, as if consumed by the intense tropic light, the devastating storms, and the mists of the rainy seasons. Kearney might have been completely forgotten but for the toy ships he had made for the boy who was now a man.\n\nHe looked down at the inquisitive child. \"I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" the child replied. \"I ask as I breathe, but the grown folk - madyana - never answer my questions, Tari. Ai, the fish!\" His attention had already shifted, drawn to the cries of children hauling in a net. He rose and hurried away.\n\nDick returned his gaze northward. The child's question had stirred his thoughts, evoking the memory of the schooner burned by Melanesian hands. He envisioned Katafa and himself escaping in the old dinghy Kearney had taught him to handle. He recalled landing on this beach only yesterday, surrounded by women and children who hailed him as a leader sent by the gods.\n\nAs he gazed towards the north, the memory of the men from whom he and Katafa had fled tainted the beauty of the sea and sky.\n\nThere was no immediate threat from the men now occupying Palm Tree. They had no canoes, but they would surely build them. And as surely as they built them, they would see the distant reflection of the Karolin lagoon in the sky, just as he had seen it, and they would come. It might be far in the future, but they would come.\n\nDick was almost entirely a Kanaka, a savage, yet the white man remained within. He could think strategically, consider all angles, and envision the future.\n\nThis was why he had dispatched a canoe that morning to the southern beach to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, three elders too old for war, yet renowned canoe builders. It was also why his spirits had lifted upon seeing nearly a hundred youths ripening into war age. But beneath it all, driving his actions and fueling his courage, lay his devotion to Katafa, his other half, more precious than himself, threatened, however vaguely, but threatened nonetheless.\n\nWar canoes! Did he intend to defend the lagoon from invaders, or perhaps to attack them before they reached shore? Or did he vaguely intend to strike the enemy at their source before they could develop into a threat? Who could know?\n\nA hand rested upon his shoulder. Turning, he found himself face to face with Katafa. A strand of dark hair, freed from the elastic vine that bound it, danced on the breeze like an eagle's feather. Her dark, luminous eyes, instead of meeting his, were focused on the northern sea line, the direction of his own gaze.\n\n\"Look!\" said Katafa.\n\nUnder certain atmospheric conditions, Palm Tree, though far beyond the visible horizon, could be seen from Karolin through mirage. They had witnessed it the previous evening, and now it was beginning to emerge again, a mysterious stain low on the southern sky, a dull spot amidst the dazzling sea. Gradually, it deepened and solidified, as if sketched by an unseen hand, revealing the island in a dreamlike vision, diaphanous yet vivid.\n\nHand on his shoulder, they stood in silence, their minds untutored, ignorant of mirage, their eyes fixed on the place from which they had escaped, now strangely rising beyond the horizon as if to observe them.\n\nThey saw again the savage horde on the beach, monstrous figures from a nightmare. They relived the wind that filled the sail as the dinghy raced for safety and the open sea, and they heard again the drunken yells of the Melanesians, driven mad by rum stolen from the schooner they had burned. There before them lay the scene of that tragedy, a beautiful picture that hid the demons still inhabiting it.\n\nAs Dick gazed upon this beauty, which was both a warning and a threat, his nostrils flared and his eyes darkened with hate. They had threatened him \u2013 that was nothing; they had threatened Katafa \u2013 that was everything \u2013 and they still threatened her.\n\nSome day, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree reinforced the instinct that already burned within him. They would build canoes, and upon seeing the reflection of the lagoon light in the sky, they would come. These men had no women, and here were women. He instinctively knew that just as he had been drawn to Katafa, so too would these men be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon for an island to raid for its women, and upon seeing the lagoon light, they would come.\n\nIf only he knew, danger lurked not only to the north, but wherever greed, desire, or hatred might roam upon that azure sea, not only among savages, but among the wolves of civilization.\n\nFor Dick, there was no world beyond the ocean that surrounded the two islands, no Europe, no America, no history save for his own life and the life of Katafa. Yet even in that short span, he had learned to dread men and to understand the foundation of all history \u2013 man's instinct for war, plunder, and destruction.\n\nGradually, the mirage of Palm Tree began to fade and vanish, like a light extinguished by the wind. Turning from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the southern beach.\n\nIt was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they descended to the white sands of the inner beach to meet it.\n",

The waves of the open sea crashed behind him, scattering spray on the wind. Before him lay the lagoon of Karolin, an ocean made calm as a lake, vast and blue, filled with fishing gulls. Held within a forty-mile ring of coral, this wide area seemed like a sea unto itself, able to have strong storms in heavy winds but becoming a blue lake in gentle breezes. It was now his, a place he had claimed only the day before.\n\nWomen, children, and young people were on the beach, doing different things in the bright sunlight: fishing with nets, playing games, and taking care of the paraka gardens. All were now his people. The canoes pulled up on the sand were his, as were the empty houses where war canoes had once sat on logs.\n\nAs his gaze moved from the lagoon to the canoe houses, a shadow crossed his face. Turning away from the lagoon, he faced the waves on the outer beach and the northern sea. There, beyond what he could see, lay Palm Tree, an island of beautiful charm, but full of unseen dangers.\n\nLittle Tari, son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat close by on the coral, watching him. Even though he was young, Tari knew that the loss of the men of Karolin in war had left the women, boys, and children unsafe, without a leader. Then, just yesterday, a stranger had arrived from the northern sea in a boat he didn't know, with Katafa, the girl who had been lost at sea years ago. The women said he was sent by the gods to be their chief and ruler.\n\nThe child, not worried about the gods, felt okay asking the new man a direct question, away from his mother's hearing.\n\n\"Taori,\" Tari asked, \"who are you?\" (\u00e9 kamina tai)\n\nIf Teja could have given an answer, would the child have understood the deep story Teja might have told? \"Tari, I come from a world you don't know. My name is Teja Lestrange. Before I was even your age, I was left on the island you call Marua (Palm Tree) with an old sailor named Kearney. We lived there, and I grew into boyhood under his care. Kearney taught me to fish and hunt, and he made small toy ships for me, not like the canoes of these islands. Then, a long time ago, Katafa, who had been swept away from Karolin in a storm, arrived. She lived with us until Kearney died, after which we were alone. She taught me her language, the language of Karolin. She named me Taori. We grew to love each other, and we could have lived forever on Marua if a ship hadn't arrived, filled with dangerous men from the eastern islands of Melanesia. They had come to cut the trees, then they fought back, killing the white men and burning the ship. We escaped in our boat, carrying everything we cared about, including the toy ships, and guided by the lagoon light in the sky, we sailed for Karolin.\"\n\nBut he could not fully say this to Tari. The name of Teja had almost left his memory, along with the language of his childhood. Kearney, the sailor who had raised him, was almost forgotten, hidden by the bright haze of his past.\n\nFor men shipwrecked and alone for a long time, the past becomes unclear and not sharp. For Teja, it began when Katafa arrived on Marua; before that, all was lost, as if eaten by the bright tropic light, the bad storms, and the fogs of the rainy seasons. Kearney might have been completely forgotten if not for the toy ships he had made for the boy who was now a man.\n\nHe looked down at the curious child. \"I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" the child replied. \"I ask as I breathe, but the grown folk - madyana - never answer my questions, Tari. Ai, the fish!\" He was now looking at something else, drawn to the shouts of children pulling in a net. He stood and hurried away.\n\nTeja looked north again. The child's question had stirred his thoughts, bringing back the memory of the schooner burned by Melanesian hands. He imagined Katafa and himself escaping in the old dinghy Kearney had taught him to use. He remembered landing on this beach only yesterday, surrounded by women and children who called him a leader sent by the gods.\n\nAs he looked towards the north, the memory of the men he and Katafa had run from ruined the beauty of the sea and sky.\n\nThere was no danger right now from the men now on Palm Tree. They had no canoes, but they would surely build them. And as sure as they built them, they would see the distant shine of the Karolin lagoon in the sky, just as he had seen it, and they would come. It might be far in the future, but they would come.\n\nTeja was almost completely a Kanaka, a savage, but the white man was still within him. He could think carefully, look at all sides, and imagine the future.\n\nThis was why he had sent a canoe that morning to the southern beach to get Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, three elders too old for war, but known as good canoe builders. It was also why he felt better when he saw almost a hundred young people growing into war age. But under it all, making him act and giving him courage, was his love for Katafa, his other half, more precious than himself, in danger, though not clearly, but still in danger.\n\nWar canoes! Did he want to defend the lagoon from attackers, or maybe to attack them before they reached the shore? Or did he have a small idea to hit the enemy at their source before they became a danger? Who could know?\n\nA hand touched his shoulder. Turning, he was face to face with Katafa. A strand of dark hair, loose from the stretchy vine that held it, danced on the breeze like an eagle's feather. Her dark, bright eyes, instead of looking at his, were focused on the northern sea line, the direction he was looking.\n\n\"Look!\" said Katafa.\n\nUnder certain weather conditions, Palm Tree, though far beyond what you could see, could be seen from Karolin through a trick of the light. They had seen it the day before, and now it was starting to appear again, a strange mark low on the southern sky, a dull spot in the bright sea. Slowly, it got deeper and stronger, as if drawn by an unseen hand, showing the island in a dreamlike vision, thin but clear.\n\nHand on his shoulder, they stood in silence, their minds not taught, not knowing about mirages, their eyes fixed on the place they had escaped from, now strangely rising beyond the horizon as if to watch them.\n\nThey saw again the savage group on the beach, monster figures from a nightmare. They remembered the wind that filled the sail as the dinghy raced for safety and the open sea, and they heard again the drunk yells of the Melanesians, made crazy by rum stolen from the schooner they had burned. There before them was the scene of that tragedy, a beautiful picture that hid the demons still living there.\n\nAs Teja looked at this beauty, which was both a warning and a threat, his nose widened and his eyes darkened with hate. They had threatened him \u2013 that was nothing; they had threatened Katafa \u2013 that was everything \u2013 and they still threatened her.\n\nSome day, they would come. The sight of Palm Tree made the feeling that already burned within him stronger. They would build canoes, and when they saw the shine of the lagoon light in the sky, they would come. These men had no women, and here were women. He knew that just as he had been drawn to Katafa, so too would these men be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would look at the horizon for an island to raid for its women, and when they saw the lagoon light, they would come.\n\nIf only he knew, danger was not only to the north, but wherever greed, want, or hate might travel on that blue sea, not only among savages, but among the wolves of civilization.\n\nFor Teja, there was no world beyond the ocean around the two islands, no Europe, no America, no history except for his own life and the life of Katafa. Yet even in that short time, he had learned to fear men and to understand the base of all history \u2013 man's desire for war, stealing, and destruction.\n\nSlowly, the mirage of Palm Tree began to fade and disappear, like a light put out by the wind. Turning from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to a canoe coming from the southern beach.\n\nIt was the canoe Teja had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they went down to the white sands of the inner beach to meet it.\n",

The relentless waves of the open sea crashed behind him, scattering salty spray that stung his face. Before him lay the lagoon of Karolin, a vast expanse of azure water, calmed by a forty-mile ring of coral reef into a serene, lake-like environment teeming with fishing gulls. This enclosed sea, prone to violent storms in heavy winds, was now, in these gentle breezes, a placid blue mirror reflecting the sky. It was now his domain, a responsibility he had accepted only yesterday.\n\nOn the beach, a vibrant tapestry of island life unfolded. Women mended nets, their laughter echoing across the sand; children shrieked with joy as they chased each other in games; and young boys tended the paraka gardens, coaxing life from the fertile soil. These were now his people, their safety his burden. The canoes pulled up on the white sand \u2013 sleek fishing vessels and the larger, more formidable war canoes that rested on sturdy log supports in the canoe houses \u2013 were his to command, his tools for protection.\n\nAs his gaze shifted from the tranquil lagoon to the imposing canoe houses, a shadow crossed his features. He turned abruptly, facing the turbulent waves on the outer beach and the vast, unforgiving northern sea. There, beyond the horizon, lay Palm Tree, an island of beguiling beauty, but a beauty that masked unseen and unspeakable dangers. He remembered the lush vegetation, the sweet scent of exotic flowers, and the chilling undercurrent of fear that permeated every moment.\n\nLittle Tari, son of Le Taioi, the village's skilled net maker, sat nearby on the jagged coral, his young eyes fixed on Teja. Despite his tender age, Tari understood the gravity of the situation. The devastating losses of Karolin's men in past wars had left the community vulnerable, its women, boys, and children desperately lacking leadership and protection. Then, just yesterday, a stranger had arrived from the northern sea in an unfamiliar boat, accompanied by Katafa, a girl long lost to the sea. Whispers rippled through the village: he was sent by the gods to be their chief, their protector, their ruler.\n\nUnburdened by such divine pronouncements, the child dared to pose a direct question, his voice barely a whisper so his mother wouldn't overhear.\n\n\"Taori,\" Tari asked, tilting his head, \"who are you?\" (\u00e9 kamina tai)\n\nIf Teja had possessed the words, would the child have comprehended the complex narrative he carried within him? \"Tari, I come from a world beyond your understanding. My name is Teja Lestrange, though I had almost forgotten it. Before I even reached your age, I was abandoned on the island you call Marua \u2013 Palm Tree \u2013 with an old sailor named Kearney. We survived there, and I grew into boyhood under his guidance. Kearney taught me the ways of the sea, how to fish with nets and hunt wild pigs, and he crafted intricate toy ships for me, miniature versions of vessels unlike the canoes of these islands. Then, years later, Katafa, who had been swept away from Karolin during a terrible storm, arrived. She lived with us until Kearney's death, after which we were truly alone. She taught me your language, the language of Karolin. She gave me the name Taori. We grew to love each other, and we could have lived out our days on Marua in peace if a ship hadn't arrived, crewed by ruthless men from the eastern islands of Melanesia. They came seeking timber, but their greed spiraled into violence. They slaughtered the white traders who resided there, set the ship ablaze, and unleashed chaos. We escaped in Kearney's old dinghy, carrying only what was essential, including the toy ships, and guided by the faint glow of the Karolin lagoon reflected in the night sky, we sailed towards your shores.\"\n\nBut he couldn't articulate this fully to Tari. The name Teja had become a distant echo, the language of his childhood a forgotten melody. Kearney, the man who had shaped his early life, was fading from memory, obscured by the harsh brilliance of his past.\n\nFor men isolated and adrift for so long, the past becomes fragmented, its details blurred. For Teja, clarity began with Katafa's arrival on Marua; everything before was lost to the relentless sun, the devastating storms, and the pervasive mists of the rainy seasons. Only the toy ships, Kearney's tangible legacy, served as a fragile link to the boy he once was.\n\nHe looked down at the inquisitive child. \"I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask such things?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" the child replied, shrugging. \"I ask as I breathe, but the grown folk \u2013 madyana \u2013 never truly answer my questions, Taori. Ai, the fish!\" He was suddenly distracted, drawn by the excited shouts of other children hauling in a fishing net. He scrambled to his feet and raced towards the commotion.\n\nTeja turned his gaze north again. The child's innocent question had stirred dormant memories, dredging up the image of the schooner consumed by flames at the hands of the Melanesians. He vividly pictured Katafa and himself desperately fleeing in the dinghy, Kearney's parting gift. He remembered the moment they landed on this beach, surrounded by wary women and children who hailed him as a divinely appointed leader.\n\nAs he looked toward Palm Tree, the memory of the men he and Katafa had escaped from tainted the beauty of the surrounding sea and sky, turning paradise into a prison of fear.\n\nThere was no immediate threat from the men remaining on Palm Tree. They were without canoes, but Teja knew they possessed the skill and the determination to build them. And with the same inevitability that drew him to Karolin, they would see the distant reflection of the lagoon in the sky, and they would come. It might be years, but their arrival was as certain as the rising sun.\n\nTeja was now almost fully integrated into the Kanaka way of life, embracing their customs and traditions. Yet, the strategic mind of the white man still resided within him. He could analyze situations, anticipate consequences, and plan for the future.\n\nThis was why he had dispatched a canoe that very morning to the southern beach, summoning Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, three respected elders too frail for battle, but renowned for their unparalleled skill in canoe construction. It was also why he found some measure of reassurance in the sight of nearly a hundred young men nearing fighting age. But underlying all these considerations, fueling his actions and bolstering his courage, was his profound love for Katafa, his soulmate, his most precious treasure, now vulnerable, if not imminently, then certainly in the future.\n\nWar canoes! Should he fortify the lagoon against invasion, or take the fight to the enemy before they could even reach Karolin? Perhaps a preemptive strike against Palm Tree, eliminating the threat at its source? The possibilities swirled in his mind.\n\nA gentle hand rested on his shoulder. He turned to face Katafa. A single strand of dark hair, escaping the woven vine that held the rest in place, danced in the breeze like a wayward feather. Her dark, luminous eyes were not focused on him, but fixed on the northern horizon, mirroring his own gaze.\n\n\"Look!\" Katafa breathed.\n\nUnder specific atmospheric conditions, Palm Tree, normally invisible at such a distance, could be glimpsed from Karolin through a trick of light. They had witnessed it the previous day, and now the ethereal vision was returning, a faint, indistinct mark low on the northern sky, a dark blemish on the bright canvas of the sea. Slowly, the image intensified, solidifying as if drawn by an unseen force, revealing the island in a dreamlike apparition, insubstantial yet unmistakable.\n\nHand resting firmly on his shoulder, they stood in silent communion, their minds untainted by scientific explanations of mirages, their eyes riveted on the island they had fled, now rising spectrally above the horizon, as if to haunt them.\n\nThey saw, once more, the savage figures silhouetted against the beach, monstrous shapes conjured from a waking nightmare. They relived the terror of that escape, the wind filling the makeshift sail as the dinghy raced across the open sea, the drunken shouts of the Melanesians fueled by stolen rum echoing in their ears. There before them was the scene of that horrific tragedy, a picture-postcard view concealing the demons that still lurked within.\n\nAs Teja stared at this deceptive beauty, a siren song of warning and threat, his nostrils flared and his eyes darkened with a fierce, possessive rage. They had threatened him \u2013 an insignificant matter; but they had threatened Katafa \u2013 an unforgivable transgression \u2013 and they continued to threaten her existence.\n\nSomeday, they would come. The spectral presence of Palm Tree intensified the burning resolve within him. They would build canoes, and when they saw the tell-tale glow of the lagoon light in the sky, they would come. These men were without women, and here, on Karolin, were women. He knew, with a primal certainty, that just as he had been drawn to Katafa, so too would these men be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scour the horizon for an island to plunder for its women, and when they saw the lagoon light, they would come.\n\nIf only he knew, the peril wasn't solely confined to the north. It lurked wherever greed, lust, or malice might travel across that seemingly endless blue sea, not only amongst so-called savages, but also amongst the predators cloaked in the veneer of civilization.\n\nFor Teja, the world was largely defined by the ocean surrounding those two islands, devoid of any knowledge of Europe, America, or the grand sweep of history beyond his own and Katafa's lived experience. Yet, in that relatively short time, he had learned to distrust men and to recognize the fundamental truth underlying all of human history \u2013 man's insatiable appetite for war, theft, and destruction.\n\nSlowly, the mirage of Palm Tree began to dissolve and vanish, like a flame extinguished by a sudden gust of wind. Turning from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed towards a canoe approaching from the southern beach.\n\nIt was the canoe Teja had sent to retrieve the canoe builders. Leaving the coral ledge, they descended onto the white sands of the inner beach, eager to greet them and begin the preparations for the storm to come.\n```",

The ceaseless ocean waves assaulted the coast behind him, scattering a saline spray that lashed his face. Before him stretched the lagoon of Karolin, an extensive expanse of cerulean water, tranquilized by a forty-mile coral reef into a serene, lacustrine environment teeming with avian piscivores. This enclosed sea, susceptible to tempestuous gales, was presently, under these gentle zephyrs, a placid azure mirror reflecting the firmament. It was now his dominion, a responsibility he had acceded to only yesterday.\n\nOn the littoral fringe, a vibrant tableau of insular existence unfolded. Women repaired nets, their peals of laughter resonating across the sand; children emitted jubilant cries as they pursued each other in playful escapades; and adolescent males cultivated the paraka gardens, nurturing sustenance from the fecund soil. These were now his constituents, their safety his onus. The canoes beached on the alabaster sand \u2013 lithe fishing vessels and the grander, more imposing war canoes that reposed on robust log supports within the canoe houses \u2013 were his to command, his implements for safeguarding.\n\nAs his regard traversed from the tranquil lagoon to the imposing canoe houses, a shadow obscured his countenance. He pivoted abruptly, confronting the turbulent waves on the outer beach and the vast, implacable northern sea. There, beyond the visible horizon, lay Palm Tree, an island of deceptive allure, a beauty concealing unseen and unspeakable perils. He recalled the verdant vegetation, the redolent fragrance of exotic flora, and the chilling undercurrent of apprehension that permeated every instant.\n\nYoung Tari, progeny of Le Taioi, the village's adept net weaver, sat proximate on the jagged coral, his nascent eyes fixated on Teja. Despite his callow age, Tari comprehended the gravity of the circumstance. The devastating attrition of Karolin's men in prior conflicts had rendered the community vulnerable, its women, boys, and children desperately bereft of leadership and defense. Then, merely yesterday, a stranger had materialized from the northern sea in an unfamiliar vessel, accompanied by Katafa, a girl long presumed lost to the sea. Whispers circulated throughout the village: he was divinely ordained to be their chieftain, their protector, their sovereign.\n\nUnencumbered by such hallowed pronouncements, the child ventured to pose a direct query, his voice scarcely audible lest his materfamilias overhear.\n\n\"Taori,\" Tari inquired, inclining his cranium, \"who are you?\" (\u00e9 kamina tai)\n\nHad Teja possessed the articulacy, would the child have grasped the intricate narrative he harbored within? \"Tari, I originate from a realm beyond your comprehension. My appellation is Teja Lestrange, though I had nearly expunged it from memory. Prior to attaining your age, I was marooned on the island you designate Marua \u2013 Palm Tree \u2013 with a senescent mariner named Kearney. We subsisted there, and I matured into boyhood under his tutelage. Kearney instructed me in the arts of navigation, the techniques of net fishing and wild pig hunting, and he fabricated elaborate toy ships for me, miniature replicas of vessels dissimilar to the canoes of these islands. Subsequently, years later, Katafa, who had been swept away from Karolin during a cataclysmic tempest, arrived. She resided with us until Kearney's demise, after which we were truly isolated. She imparted to me your tongue, the language of Karolin. She bestowed upon me the sobriquet Taori. We developed mutual affection, and we could have perpetuated our existence on Marua in tranquility had a vessel not materialized, crewed by ruthless individuals from the eastern isles of Melanesia. They arrived seeking lumber, but their avarice spiraled into belligerence. They butchered the Caucasian traders who dwelled there, incinerated the ship, and unleashed pandemonium. We absconded in Kearney's dilapidated dinghy, carrying only essential provisions, including the toy ships, and guided by the faint luminescence of the Karolin lagoon reflected in the nocturnal sky, we navigated toward your shores.\"\n\nBut he lacked the capacity to articulate this comprehensively to Tari. The name Teja had become a remote echo, the vernacular of his infancy a forgotten melody. Kearney, the man who had molded his formative years, was receding from recollection, obscured by the piercing brilliance of his past.\n\nFor individuals isolated and adrift for prolonged durations, the past becomes fragmented, its particulars obfuscated. For Teja, lucidity commenced with Katafa's advent on Marua; all antecedent events were obliterated by the relentless solar irradiation, the devastating atmospheric disturbances, and the pervasive mists of the pluvial seasons. Only the toy ships, Kearney's tangible inheritance, served as a tenuous nexus to the boy he once embodied.\n\nHe cast his gaze upon the inquisitive child. \"I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you propound such inquiries?\"\n\n\"I am uncertain,\" the child responded, shrugging his shoulders. \"I inquire as I respire, but the adult populace \u2013 madyana \u2013 seldom furnish veracious replies to my interrogations, Taori. Ai, the fish!\" He was abruptly diverted, attracted by the animated exclamations of other juveniles hauling in a fishing seine. He clambered to his feet and hastened toward the commotion.\n\nTeja redirected his gaze northwards. The child's ingenuous question had galvanized dormant memories, resurrecting the image of the schooner immolated at the hands of the Melanesians. He vividly envisioned Katafa and himself frantically fleeing in the dinghy, Kearney's parting benefaction. He recollected the moment they disembarked on this beach, surrounded by circumspect women and children who hailed him as a divinely appointed leader.\n\nAs he contemplated Palm Tree, the recollection of the men he and Katafa had eluded tainted the pulchritude of the circumambient sea and sky, transforming paradise into a penitentiary of trepidation.\n\nNo immediate menace emanated from the surviving men on Palm Tree. They were devoid of canoes, but Teja recognized their proficiency and resolve to construct them. And with the same inexorability that had drawn him to Karolin, they would discern the distant reflection of the lagoon in the heavens, and they would arrive. It might require years, but their advent was as certain as the diurnal sunrise.\n\nTeja was now virtually assimilated into the Kanaka modus vivendi, embracing their conventions and traditions. Yet, the strategic intellect of the Caucasian man persisted within him. He could dissect scenarios, anticipate ramifications, and strategize for the future.\n\nThis was the impetus behind his dispatching a canoe that very morn to the southern coast, summoning Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, three venerated elders too infirm for combat, but celebrated for their unparalleled expertise in canoe fabrication. It was also the explanation for his deriving a modicum of reassurance from the spectacle of nearly a hundred adolescent males approaching martial maturity. But underpinning all these deliberations, fueling his endeavors and fortifying his fortitude, was his profound affection for Katafa, his anima gemella, his most cherished treasure, now susceptible, if not imminently, then assuredly in the future.\n\nWar canoes! Should he fortify the lagoon against invasion, or undertake a preemptive assault against the adversary before they could even reach Karolin? Perhaps an offensive strike against Palm Tree, eradicating the menace at its genesis? The possibilities swirled within his cerebrum.\n\nA gentle manus rested upon his humerus. He turned to confront Katafa. A solitary strand of ebon hair, escaping the woven vine that secured the remainder in position, danced in the breeze like a wayward plume. Her dark, luminous oculars were not directed upon him, but fixated upon the northern horizon, mirroring his own regard.\n\n\"Perceive!\" Katafa breathed.\n\nUnder specific atmospheric conditions, Palm Tree, normally imperceptible at such a remove, could be glimpsed from Karolin through an optical illusion. They had witnessed it on the preceding day, and now the ethereal apparition was recurring, a faint, indistinct mark low on the northern sky, a dark imperfection on the effulgent canvas of the sea. Gradually, the image intensified, solidifying as if delineated by an unseen entity, revealing the island in a dreamlike vision, insubstantial yet unmistakable.\n\nManus resting firmly upon his humerus, they stood in tacit communion, their intellects unblemished by scientific elucidations of mirages, their oculars riveted upon the island they had fled, now rising spectrally above the horizon, as if to haunt them.\n\nThey beheld, once more, the savage figures silhouetted against the beach, monstrous forms conjured from a waking nightmare. They relived the terror of that escape, the wind inflating the makeshift sail as the dinghy raced across the open sea, the inebriated shouts of the Melanesians fueled by stolen rum reverberating in their auditory canals. There before them was the scene of that horrific tragedy, a picture-postcard vista concealing the daemons that still lurked within.\n\nAs Teja stared at this deceptive pulchritude, a siren song of warning and threat, his nares dilated and his oculars darkened with a fierce, possessive rage. They had threatened him \u2013 an inconsequential matter; but they had threatened Katafa \u2013 an unforgivable transgression \u2013 and they persisted in threatening her existence.\n\nSomeday, they would arrive. The spectral presence of Palm Tree augmented the burning resolve within him. They would fabricate canoes, and upon discerning the telltale luminescence of the lagoon light in the heavens, they would arrive. These men were bereft of women, and here, on Karolin, were women. He knew, with a primal certitude, that just as he had been drawn to Katafa, so too would these men be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scour the horizon for an island to pillage for its women, and upon perceiving the lagoon light, they would arrive.\n\nIf only he were cognizant that the peril was not solely confined to the north. It lurked wherever avarice, lust, or malevolence might traverse that seemingly boundless cerulean sea, not only amongst so-called savages, but also amongst the predators cloaked in the veneer of civilization.\n\nFor Teja, the world was largely delimited by the ocean encompassing those two islands, devoid of any cognizance of Europe, America, or the grand panorama of history beyond his own and Katafa's experiential existence. Yet, within that relatively abbreviated timeframe, he had assimilated to distrust men and to recognize the fundamental verity underpinning all of human history \u2013 man's insatiable appetency for war, theft, and ruination.\n\nGradually, the mirage of Palm Tree commenced to dissolve and evanesce, like a flame extinguished by a sudden gust of wind. Turning from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa indicated a canoe approaching from the southern coast.\n\nIt was the canoe Teja had dispatched to retrieve the canoe artificers. Departing the coral precipice, they descended onto the alabaster sands of the inner beach, eager to greet them and initiate preparations for the impending storm.\n```",

    "spun_text": "This is a cleaned-up and professional-sounding version of the provided text, focusing on the story content and removing the extraneous navigation and site information.\n\n**Chapter II: The Revolt of the Old Men**\n\nTwo women skillfully navigated a canoe, beaching it with the outrigger tilted. Dick, followed by Katafa, approached as they disembarked, paddles in hand. Dick, resting his hand on the mast stays secured to the outrigger, inquired, \"Where are the builders?\"\n\nThe shorter woman made a dismissive sound, averting her gaze toward the lagoon. The taller woman met Dick's eyes directly. \"They will not come. They claim Uta Matu was their only king, and he is dead. Further, they say they are too old \u2013 *'A mataya ayana'* \u2013 feeble and nearing the end of their fishing days, even in calm waters.\"\n\nThe shorter woman stifled a laugh and turned to Dick. \"They will not come, Taori. All else is merely talk.\"\n\nShe was correct. Despite the express order to cross over, the builders refused, unwilling to acknowledge the newcomer as their chief. This refusal ignited hushed discussions amongst the villagers gathering near the canoe. Dick, his foot resting on the tilted outrigger, appeared to study the sennit binding with intense concentration.\n\nThe initial flash of anger had subsided, replaced by thoughtful contemplation. This was no ordinary matter. While unfamiliar with the concepts of \"revolt\" or \"authority,\" Dick understood the implications. The only men capable of directing the construction of large war canoes refused to cooperate. The women's demeanor conveyed a clear message: if the canoe-builders were not brought into line, Dick's ability to command the natives would be severely compromised.\n\nDick wasted little time in deliberation. He quickly retrieved a fish spear from the house where the model ships were carefully stored. Calling to the women, he helped haul the canoe out, boarded, and assisted in raising the mat sail to catch the wind.\n\n\"I will return soon,\" he called to Katafa, his voice carried on the breeze. The women crouched to ballast the canoe, and Dick steered with the paddle.\n\nThe canoe that had carried Katafa to Palm Tree years earlier had been Dick's first exposure to South Sea island craft. Its fascination had remained. This canoe was larger, with a broader beam, and the outrigger \u2013 a long, skate-shaped piece of wood \u2013 was connected by a bridge rather than poles.\n\nAs he steered, Dick meticulously observed every detail: the rattans of the grating, the mast stays, the stepped mast, the outrigger's curve, and the mat sail's attachment to the yard. Despite his inexperience, his innate seafaring instincts guided him. The watching women noted no hesitation in his movements.\n\nAware of the two primary ways to capsize such a canoe \u2013 by letting the outrigger rise too high or dip too low \u2013 Dick skillfully avoided both dangers as they navigated the waves breaking from the reef.\n\nThe beach where the southern tribe remnants resided was directly opposite the northern tribe's beach, close to the reef break, approximately a mile distant. As they approached, Dick clearly saw the rebels seated in the shade of jackfruit trees near the easternmost hut. A girl lay close to a small pool.\n\nAs Dick, accompanied by the taller woman, neared, the girl, Le Moan, looked up. She was the fourteen-year-old granddaughter of Le Juan, the deceased witch woman of Karolin. Le Moan had heard of the new ruler and Katafa's return. She had witnessed her grandfather Aioma's refusal of the order to build canoes. She wondered about this new chief. The imposing figure of Uta Matu, Karolin's last king, came to mind. As the canoe was hauled up and the women announced, \"He comes,\" she saw Dick.\n\nThe sun illuminated his face and red-gold hair. He was naked, honey-colored, lithe as a panther, and straight as a spear. His gaze fixed on the three old men.\n\nLe Moan caught her breath as the vision approached, passed her without a word, and stood before Aioma, the most renowned of the canoe-builders.\n\nLe Moan was tall for her age, almost as tall as Katafa. Though her mother was a native of Karolin, her father, a sailor from a Spanish ship destroyed by Uta Matu, had given her striking European features, setting her apart from other islanders.\n\nShe was beautiful, her dark beauty just beginning to blossom, and as mysterious as the ocean depths. Sometimes, seated beneath the jackfruit trees, she would listen intently, as if hearing a distant voice. Other times, she gazed into the reef pools, seemingly seeing more than just fish.\n\nThe blending of two alien races often produces strange results. Le Moan seemed almost overwhelmed by ancestral voices or visions.\n\nShe accompanied Aioma fishing, and he never feared losing sight of land with her aboard, for she was a pathfinder. Blindfolded, she could navigate the coral. Taken beyond the sea line, she returned like a homing pigeon, guided by an internal compass.\n\nThis was her only inheritance from her mother, La Jennabon, who had received it from seafaring ancestors.\n\nCrouching by the well, she saw Dick facing Aioma and heard him speak.\n\n\"Are you Aioma?\" Dick asked, instinctively identifying the leader.\n\nThe three old men rose. The sight of the newcomer and his accurate identification of Aioma impressed them. Surely, this was a chief.\n\n\"I am Aioma,\" he replied. \"What do you want of me?\"\n\n\"What the woman has already told you,\" Dick replied, disliking repetition.\n\n\"They spoke of the new chief on the northern beach \u2013 *e uma kaio tau* \u2013 and his order to build canoes,\" Aioma said. \"I said, 'I am too old, and Uta is dead. I know no chief but Uta. Moreover, in the last war on the northern island, all the men of Karolin perished, and their canoes were lost. What is the use of building more canoes when there are no men to fill them?'\"\n\n\"The men are growing,\" Dick said.\n\n\"Aye, they are growing,\" Aioma grumbled, \"but many moons will pass before they can handle a paddle and spear. And where is the enemy? The sea is clear.\"\n\n\"Aioma,\" Dick said, pointing north, \"I come from there. The sea is not clear.\"\n\n\"You come from Marua (Palm Tree)?\"\n\n\"I come from Marua, where Katafa was carried by the wind. We lived there until men landed, killing, burning, and destroying the big canoe they arrived in. Then Katafa and I sailed for Karolin, for Karolin called me to rule her people.\"\n\n\"And the men who kill and burn?\" Aioma asked.\n\n\"They remain on Marua. They lack canoes, but they will build them and surely come.\"\n\nAioma's companions remained silent as he consulted the ground. Then he looked up at Dick. Age and war had made him wise. He recognized men and truth.\n\n\"I will do your bidding, Taori,\" he said simply. He instructed his companions and led the way to the canoe.\n\nLe Moan remained crouched by the well, her eyes fixed on Dick, a creature unlike anyone she had known. Perhaps she sensed a connection to her father's race, or perhaps she was simply captivated by his youth and grace.\n\nDick, turning, noticed her for the first time. Her gaze and unique appearance held him momentarily. Then, breaking the contact, he pushed off, the wind filling the sail.\n\nLe Moan rose, shading her eyes as she watched the canoe grow smaller, rising and falling on the waves, until it reached the northern beach where Katafa awaited her lover.\n\n**Chapter III: The Little Ships**\n\nThe primitive Pacific canoe is a dugout, a tree trunk hollowed and shaped into a boat. Its narrowness makes it unstable without the outrigger, a long, skate-shaped piece of wood fixed to the port side by poles on a bridge. The outrigger compensates for the lack of beam, enabling the canoe to navigate the sea. Without it, the islands would have been isolated, war impossible, and the migration of people between islands and continents hindered.\n\nLong ago, a pioneering inventor conceived of this device, unaware of its far-reaching consequences.\n\nDick, at the steering paddle, saw Katafa on the northern beach, shielding her eyes from the sun, her dracaena leaf girdle swaying in the wind. She stood as Le Moan had stood on the southern beach, watching the canoe carrying the man who had captured her attention.\n\nChildren played near Katafa, and a fishing canoe set out nearby, but Dick saw only her.\n\n\"Katafa,\" Aioma said, crouched by the outrigger pole, \"It is she. They said she was dead, her ghost returning with you, Taori. But the dead do not return. Katafa was under Taminan's taboo, untouchable. Then, one day, she fished beyond the reef, a storm took her, and she drowned, they said.\"\n\n\"She did not drown,\" Dick replied. \"The wind carried her to Marua, where I was with another, Kearney. He built canoes, but not like these. One day, he walked among the trees and never returned. Then Nan came to the island, followed by the men of Karolin, who fought and died. Then came the bad men, and we fled Marua at night... Look, there is our canoe.\" He pointed to the dinghy.\n\n\"O he! Taori!\" Katafa's voice, clear and sweet as a bell, hailed them.\n\nDick leaped onto the sand and embraced her. Separated for only hours, it felt like weeks.\n\nIn the past, even before his birth, his mother Emmeline had always felt uneasy when separated from his father, fearing misfortune. Dick seemed to have inherited this apprehension for Katafa's well-being along with his love.\n\nHe embraced her, oblivious to onlookers, though only the children and Aioma, whose attention was fixed on the dinghy, were watching.\n\nThe canoe-builder ran to the dinghy, touching the gunwale and examining the planking.\n\nThe Spanish ship's boats had been clinker-built and destroyed, but he had seen fragments washed ashore. The carvel-built dinghy was a perfect example of western boat-building. The idea of a planked boat, rather than one hollowed from a tree, had been inspired by the charred remains of the Spanish boats. However, how to obtain and bend the planking was beyond his understanding and resources. He vaguely recognized the structure: a backbone, ribs, and a covering. He saw that this construction allowed for a wider beam, eliminating the need for an outrigger. But where was the speed in this squat, ugly vessel?\n\nIn Aioma's world, ugliness manifested in two ways: lines that lacked speed and lines that lacked strength.\n\nDick, though as brown as the canoe-builder, was millions of years younger, just as the dinghy was millions of years younger than the fishing canoe. Aioma saw only the lines indicating speed and strength in Dick. He was blind to the nobility of his face and the far-sightedness in his eyes. In the dinghy, Aioma saw only a lack of speed, blind to the ingenuity that made it the sister of a battleship, a vertebrate compared to the keel-less, rib-less dugout.\n\nAioma began to mock the dinghy, chuckling, then clucking, then laughing loudly.\n\n\"Which end is which of this pig fish?\" he asked of heaven and Dick, \"And he who made her, how many more did he make like her?\"\n\nDick, associating the dinghy with Kearney, felt a sting. Perhaps it was his white blood reacting to a savage deriding a white man's creation. He ran to the house of Uta Matu, now his and Katafa's, and retrieved the model ships he had salvaged from Palm Tree: the frigate, the schooner, the full-rigged ship, and the whaler. Toys of the past, they were now fetishes from a world whose language he had forgotten, a world of sun and tall trees where Kearney, like a ghost, lingered in his memory.\n\nHe launched the schooner in a large coral pool, calling Aioma to witness the creation of the dinghy's maker.\n\nThe clear pool, ruffled by the breeze, was thirty feet long and twenty feet wide. A school of needle-sized fish darted through it. Dick launched the schooner. Aioma watched as it floated on an even keel. Then, sailing on the wind, the schooner sailed down the pool to Katafa.\n\nAioma watched. Dick showed him how it could sail against the wind. Dick knew every detail. Had he been on a real schooner, he could have worked her from his model. Aioma was intrigued. He knelt, and the sun saw the builders of Karolin's future fleet playing like children, the little schooner sailing from port to port, bowing to the ripples as the lost Raratonga had bowed to the swell of the Pacific.\n",

    "spun_text": "This is a professionally formatted version of Chapter 9 from Henry De Vere Stacpoole's \"The Gates of Morning,\" Book 1.\n\n**The Gates of Morning**\n\n*By Henry De Vere Stacpoole*\n\n**Book 1, Chapter 9: CASHI**\n\nLe Moan's existence had been devoid of pity, shaped by the merciless environment in which she lived. Any nascent compassion within her had been stifled, never allowed to flourish. She had witnessed the destruction of her tribe, their relentless pursuit to the sea by Uta Matu's northern forces, the horrors of battle, murder, sudden death, storms, and devastation. Encounters with swordfish in combat, the frenzied bloodlust of fish, bowhead whales succumbing to orcas, and the predation of tiger sharks on humans, had all failed to evoke pity within her, akin to the stoicism of Rantan. Yet, a vast chasm separated these two pitiless individuals.\n\nLe Moan had selflessly sacrificed herself for Taori, confronting the unknown, a fate worse than death, driven by her passion for him. However, this sacrifice led to an even more profound agony: separation.\n\nTo reunite with Taori, she would have readily destroyed the *Kermadec* and its crew without hesitation, just as she would have willingly sacrificed herself to save him. Rantan, however, was incapable of comprehending such devotion, even if meticulously explained with diagrams illustrating Le Moan's savage soul, illuminated only by the blazing flame of her love for Taori.\n\nThroughout the day, Rantan meticulously formulated his sinister plan, assessing his resources: Sru, Carlin, the crew, the ship, and lastly, the Kanaka girl, whom he regarded merely as a navigational tool, guided by instinct like fish and birds. He considered her insignificant, devoid of any real value.\n\nThe *Kermadec* had previously loaded turtle shell at Soma and was scheduled to collect a cargo of sandalwood at Levua. San Francisco was the intended next port of call, although Rantan doubted they would ever reach it. The success of his plan hinged on Carlin. Rantan could not execute it alone, even with Sru's assistance. Carlin, a beachcomber, would inevitably succumb to a bottle of whiskey if left unattended, but his status as a white man was crucial. Although his behavior would warrant dismissal from most ships, Rantan believed a white accomplice was essential for his desperate scheme. That night, Rantan approached Carlin to gauge his interest.\n\n\"We're due at Levua tomorrow,\" Rantan initiated. \"Ever been there?\"\n\n\"Don't know it,\" Carlin responded, \"and don't care to. According to the old man, there's nothing there but a sandalwood trader and the Kanakas he uses for cutting wood. I'm planning to beach at Tahiti once we reach 'Frisco; plenty of boats run down from 'Frisco to Tahiti.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Rantan countered, \"but it seems to me there's not much going on in Tahiti. Hasn't it ever occurred to you that there's money to be made in the islands, better than bumming around on the beach? I'm not talking about hard labor, handling cargo or running a ship\u2014I mean easy money, plenty of it.\"\n\nThe large, red-faced man chuckled and spat over the rail. \"Not likely,\" he replied. \"Not for the likes of me or you. Clam shells are all we'll find after the big shots have had their fill.\"\n\n\"How would you like ten thousand dollars in your hand?\" Rantan inquired, \"Twenty\u2014thirty\u2014who knows how much it could be, and all for simply watching Kanakas dive for pearls.\"\n\nCarlin eyed his companion cautiously. \"What are you getting at?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you,\" Rantan said, \"I know of a pearl island, not far from here. It's a sealed lagoon, untouched. There's enough there to make a dozen men rich. But to get there, I'd need a ship, which I don't have, nor the money to charter one. I'm in the same boat as you, see?\"\n\n\"What are you getting at?\" Carlin repeated, his tone now sharper.\n\n\"I'm just saying I don't have a ship,\" Rantan reiterated, \"but I know where to acquire one if I could find a chap to help me take her.\"\n\nCarlin leaned further over the rail, spitting into the sea once more. His instincts had grasped the full implications of Rantan's words.\n\n\"And what about the Kanakas?\" he inquired. \"Kanakas are damn fools, but get them into a courtroom and they turn into bilge pumps for evidence. I've seen it,\" he concluded, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. \"A sinking job it was, and the chap that did it got ten years, based on Kanaka testimony.\"\n\nRantan chuckled. \"Leave the Kanakas to me,\" he assured. \"I'm putting it to you\u2014if I've got the guts to do the job, will you help?\"\n\n\"I'm not saying I wouldn't,\" Carlin replied, \"but what about the navigating? You're not much good at that...or are you? Maybe you've been holding something back.\"\n\n\"I'm good enough to get there,\" Rantan asserted. \"Well, think it over. We have time and no need to rush. But remember, there's no limit to the money involved, and if it comes to doing it, don't worry about risks; I'm not one to take more than ordinary chances, and I'll arrange everything.\"\n\nRantan then turned and walked aft, leaving Carlin contemplating the offer at the rail.\n\nRegardless of Carlin's origins, he was now as weathered and discarded as the old cans found tossed about the reef, their labels gone, revealing nothing of their past contents. The most capable men would deteriorate on the beach; the combination of sun and inactivity kills or demoralizes more men than whiskey. One must be born to the sun, like Katafa, Dick, or Le Moan, and never have worn clothes, to withstand it.\n\nOccasionally, a white man is immune to the sun's effects, both inside and out, but such cases are rare. Carlin's skin was impervious to the relentless, invisible rays, and he thrived in the sun; however, his internal fortitude had crumbled.\n\nHe harbored a single ambition: whiskey\u2014or rum, or gin, or even samshu, but whiskey was his preference.\n\nWhiskey was present on the *Kermadec*, but not for Carlin's consumption. Peterson, as abstemious as Rantan, guarded it, just as he secured the Viterli rifles in the arms rack, for use in emergencies. It was kept under lock and key, but Carlin had detected its presence.\n\nIts presence on board was like that of an evil spirit: unseen, yet exerting its influence. It constantly reminded him of Rantan's words at supper, and its influence persisted even in his sleep. In his dreams, he envisioned the vessel sailing towards the unknown pearl island, bathed in the golden light of fortune and unlimited whiskey. He was on deck with Rantan in command, Peterson absent.\n\nThe dream omitted any mention of Peterson, completely disregarding him. Peterson, on deck at that moment, was oblivious to the beachcomber's visions of the *Kermadec* deviating from its course and without its skipper.\n\nThe following morning, during the morning watch, Sru was at the wheel and Rantan, a pipe in his mouth, stood by the weather rail. The sun had just risen, obliterating the night and casting a golden hue across the wind-whipped blue of the swell.\n\nThe sunrise struck the *Kermadec* like the sudden clap of a hot hand: Sru felt it on his back, and Rantan on his cheek. From the windward side came the cry of a gull, which then passed overhead, circling as if inspecting the schooner, and drifted off on the wind. Almost simultaneously, the Kanaka lookout shouted, \"Land!\"\n\nRantan walked forward. Directly ahead, glowing rosily above the boundless sea, lay the cloud scarf of Levua.\n\nStill distant, facing the blazing east, the island, free of any trace of morning mist, appeared to float between the blue of the sea and sky, remote and more beautiful than any dream.\n\nUpon returning aft, Rantan found Le Moan standing with Sru at the wheel. Sru was demonstrating how the wheel operated the \"steering paddle\" in the stern. The *Kermadec* was close-hauled, every sail full. Sru was explaining that the slightest movement closer to the wind would cause the sails to shiver and reduce the ship's speed. Le Moan comprehended. Seafaring was ingrained in her, and now accustomed to the vast sail area of the schooner, she felt no fear. The *Kermadec* was, after all, just a larger, differently constructed canoe.\n\nHe allowed her to hold the spokes for a moment, guiding the wheel with a steadying hand, then, at the risk of the schooner being taken aback, he stepped aside and allowed her to take the helm.\n\nFor a moment, the *Kermadec* showed no indication that control had changed hands. Then, suddenly, a subtle tremor passed through the canvas from the luff of the mainsail, before ceasing as the sail filled again. Le Moan had instinctively grasped the constant pressure against the lee bow that tends to force a vessel's head into the wind.\n\nFor a fleeting moment, Taori, Karolin, and even Sru's presence were forgotten, as were the words he had spoken to her moments before: \"You will soon see Taori, little one, but first you must learn to use the steering paddle.\" Everything was eclipsed by the novel sensation of commanding the vast sail area, engaging in a thrilling dance with the wind and the sea.\n\nAioma had taught her to steer her fishing canoe long ago, but she could not recall the first time she had held the paddle alone. This was different, as distinct as a lover's kiss from a friend's\u2014something that resonated with her soul. It was as distinct as the sight of Taori from that of other men: grand, thrilling, elevating her, and creating a sense of agency.\n\nUtterly ignorant of the mechanism that moved the rudder, much like a man is oblivious to the mechanics of his own arm, she could not err after the first few minutes of this remarkable experience. She knew nothing of the compass, only that she must keep the ship close-hauled, as Sru had been doing, so close that the slightest movement into the wind would spill the sails. Sru observed her, and Rantan, forgetting his pipe, watched with unwavering focus. Both men recognized that the ship was, for the moment, in safe hands. One might have assumed they were admiring her silhouette against the blue sky and the glory of the morning, but their interest was motivated neither by aesthetic appreciation, love, passion, nor seamanship.\n\nAs they stood there, as if Tragedy had orchestrated the scene for some unseen audience, Peterson's head and shoulders emerged from the saloon hatch opening.\n\nRantan's face paled, Sru drew the back of his hand across his nose as if wiping it, shifted his weight from one foot to the other, looking like a dog caught misbehaving. Le Moan remained oblivious.\n\nWhile maintaining her focus on the wheel, her thoughts had briefly drifted. She saw herself steering the *Kermadec* towards Karolin, visualizing the distant reef, the gulls, and the captivating blue of the vast lagoon beyond the reef.\n\nPeterson, without fully emerging onto the deck, watched her for a moment, understanding only that the girl had been allowed to take the helm. Then, as Sru took the spokes from her and pushed her forward, the captain of the *Kermadec* turned to Rantan, but the abuse on his lips was checked by the mate's expression.\n\n\"Don't you ever do a thing like that again,\" Peterson rebuked. \"Dam' tomfoolery.\" He snorted and went forward, kicked a Kanaka out of his way, and then stood, gazing at the distant vision of Levua, opal-tinted in the blue northern sky.\n",

Behind him, the ocean's breakers crashed, scattering spindrift on the wind; before him, the Karolin lagoon stretched out, a serene expanse of azure mirroring the sky, dotted with fishing gulls. Enclosed by a forty-mile coral ring, this immense lagoon possessed the character of a sea, capable of violent storms yet often tranquil. He considered it his domain, having arrived only the previous day.\n\nWomen, children, and youths were visible along the beach, engaged in fishing, games, and tending to the paraka patches. He regarded them as his people. The canoes drawn up on the sand, and the empty houses that once sheltered war canoes, were also his responsibility.\n\nHis brow furrowed as his gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses. Turning his back to the lagoon, he faced the breakers and the northern sea. Beyond the horizon lay Palm Tree, an island of ethereal beauty, yet, in his mind, teeming with potential danger.\n\nLittle Tari, son of the net maker Le Taioi, observed him from a nearby coral outcrop. Though young, Tari understood that the war had depleted the men of Karolin, leaving the women, boys, and children vulnerable and leaderless. The previous day, a figure had arrived from the northern sea in a strange boat, accompanied by Katafa, a girl lost at sea years prior. The women believed this newcomer to be sent by the gods as their chief and ruler.\n\nThe child, unconcerned with the nature of deities and emboldened by the absence of his mother, posed a direct question with childlike simplicity: \"Taori,\" he asked, \"who are you?\"\n\nHad Dick been able to fully articulate his past, would the child have comprehended the complex narrative? \"Tari, I hail from a land beyond your comprehension. My name is Dick Lestrange, and when I was a young boy, I was stranded with an old sailor on the island you call Marua (Palm Tree). There, Kearney, as he was called, taught me to fish and craft miniature ships unlike your island canoes. Years ago, Katafa, who had been carried away from here in a storm, joined us. After Kearney's death, we were left alone. She taught me her language, the language of Karolin, and named me Taori. We loved each other and might have lived forever on Marua, were it not for a ship filled with Melanesian men seeking lumber. They killed the white men on board, burned the ship, and we fled in our boat, carrying with us all we cherished, including the miniature ships, guided by the lagoon's reflected light.\"\n\nHowever, he could not convey this entire story. The name \"Dick\" had faded from his memory, and the language of his childhood was largely lost. Kearney, his mentor, was a hazy memory. Dick's conscious past began with Katafa's arrival on Marua. Before that, everything was obscured by the intense tropical light, storms, and rainy seasons. Kearney was only recalled due to the miniature ships he had fashioned as toys for the boy who was now a man.\n\nHe looked down at the inquisitive child. \"I am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" the child replied. \"I ask as I breathe, but adults rarely answer the questions of Tari. Ah, the fish!\" His attention diverted by children hauling in a net, he abandoned the subject and ran off.\n\nDick turned his gaze north once more. The child's question stirred his memories, conjuring the image of the schooner burned by the Melanesians on Palm Tree, and the image of Katafa and himself escaping in Kearney's old dinghy. He recalled their landing on this beach the day before, the women and children flocking to him, regarding him as a divinely appointed leader.\n\nGazing northward, the memory of the men from whom he had escaped tainted the beauty of the sea and sky. While there was no immediate threat from the men of Palm Tree, who lacked canoes, Dick surmised they would inevitably construct them. They would see the distant reflection of the Karolin lagoon and venture here. It might be distant, but it would happen.\n\nThough largely assimilated, the \"white man\" in Dick retained the capacity for forward thinking, comprehensive analysis, and imagination. He had dispatched a canoe that morning to the southern beach to retrieve Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, three elderly but skilled canoe builders. He had also observed the nearly one hundred youths approaching warrior age within the tribe. Above all, his actions were fueled by his deep affection for Katafa, his cherished companion who, though seemingly secure, was still potentially threatened.\n\nWould he confront the invaders in the lagoon or on the shore, or would he attempt to eliminate the threat at its source? It remained to be seen.\n\nA hand touched his shoulder. Turning, he faced Katafa. A strand of her dark hair, escaping the vine that bound it, blew in the breeze, resembling an eagle's feather. Her dark, luminous eyes were fixed on the northern horizon.\n\n\"Look!\" Katafa exclaimed.\n\nUnder certain weather conditions, Palm Tree, though beyond the horizon, became visible from Karolin through a mirage. They had observed it the previous evening, and now it was emerging again, a low, enigmatic stain in the southern sky, gradually solidifying into a clear, ethereal image.\n\nThey stood in silence, their minds untrained in the science of mirages, their eyes fixed on the island from which they had fled, rising strangely beyond the horizon as if to observe them.\n\nThey relived the sight of the savages on the beach, the wind filling their sail as the dinghy raced towards the open sea, and the yells of the rum-crazed Melanesians. There, before them, lay the scene of their harrowing escape, a deceptively beautiful picture masking the demons that still inhabited it.\n\nAs Dick gazed at this beguiling yet ominous scene, his nostrils flared, and his eyes darkened with resentment. The threat against him was inconsequential; the threat against Katafa was paramount.\n\nSomeday, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to confirm his intuition. They would build canoes, see the reflection of the lagoon in the sky, and they would come. They lacked women, and Karolin had them. He had been drawn to Katafa, and these men would be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon for an island to raid for women, and seeing the lagoon's reflection, they would come.\n\nUnbeknownst to him, danger existed not only to the north, but wherever greed, desire, or hatred roamed on that azure sea, not only among savages, but within the wolves of civilization as well.\n\nDick's world consisted solely of the water surrounding the two islands; he knew no Europe, no America, no history beyond his own and Katafa's. Yet, even in their short lives, he had learned to fear men and had glimpsed the foundations of all history\u2014man's inclination for war, rapine, and destruction.\n\nThe vision of Palm Tree gradually faded and vanished. As they turned from the sea towards the lagoon, Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the southern beach.\n\nIt was the canoe Dick had dispatched for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral ledge, they descended to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.\n",

Behind him, the outer sea's breakers crashed, scattering spindrift on the wind. Before him, the lagoon stretched, an expanse of infinite blue serenity frequented by fishing gulls, its calm contrasting starkly with the tumultuous sea. Encased within its forty-mile coral ring, this vast expanse held the potential for both tempestuous storms and serene azure stillness. This land, where he had arrived only the day before, was now his domain.\n\nWomen, children, and youths, engaged in their daily activities along the sun-drenched beach \u2013 fishing, playing, or tending to the paraka patches \u2013 were now his people. The canoes resting on the sand and the empty houses that once sheltered war canoes were also his responsibility.\n\nHowever, as his gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, his brow furrowed. Turning his back to the lagoon, he faced the breakers on the outer beach and the northern sea. There, beyond the horizon, lay Palm Tree, an island of captivating beauty, yet teeming with potential threats.\n\nLittle Tari, son of the net maker Le Taioi, sitting nearby, looked up at him. Despite his youth, Tari understood that the loss of Karolin's men in war had left the women and children vulnerable, devoid of a male leader. Then, just yesterday, this unfamiliar figure had arrived from the northern sea, accompanied by Katafa, a girl lost at sea years ago. The women believed he was sent by the gods to be their chief and ruler.\n\nUnconcerned with the identity of these gods, the child seized the opportunity, away from his mother's earshot, to directly inquire of this extraordinary individual:\n\n\u201cTaori,\u201d the child inquired, \u201cwho are you?\u201d\n\nCould Dick have articulated the complex narrative of his past, would the child have grasped it? \"Tari, I originate from beyond your known world. My name is Dick Lestrange, and in my youth, I was left on the island you call Marua (Palm Tree), situated fifty miles to the north, with an old sailor named Kearney. We lived there, and Kearney taught me to fish and craft miniature ships unlike your island canoes. Then, long ago, Katafa, who had drifted away from here in a storm, joined us. After Kearney's death, we were alone. She taught me her language, the language of Karolin. She named me Taori. We found contentment at Marua until a large ship arrived, carrying nefarious men from Melanesia. They came to fell trees, subsequently killing the white men on board and burning the ship. We escaped in our boat, carrying our cherished possessions, including the miniature ships, and guided by the lagoon light in the sky, we sailed to Karolin.\"\n\nHe was unable to fully articulate this story to Tari, as the name Dick, and the language he spoke as a child, had faded from his memory. Kearney, the sailor who raised him, remained a hazy memory, overshadowed by the luminous light of his past.\n\nFor men long shipwrecked and isolated, the past becomes obscure. For Dick, his conscious history began with Katafa's arrival on Marua. Before that, everything was obscured, as if consumed by the intense tropic light, the storms, and the rainy seasons. Kearney would have been completely forgotten were it not for the miniature ships he had crafted for the boy who was now a man.\n\nHe looked down at the inquisitive child. \u201cI am Taori, Tari tatu. Why do you ask?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know,\u201d the child replied. \u201cI ask as naturally as I breathe, but the adults never answer Tari\u2019s questions. Ah, the fish!\u201d The child's attention had already shifted, drawn to the cries of children hauling in a net. He scampered away.\n\nDick turned his gaze northward once more. The child's question had stirred his memories. He recalled the schooner arriving at Palm Tree, only to be burned by the Melanesian crew. He saw Katafa and himself escaping in Kearney's dinghy. He remembered their arrival on this beach the previous day, and the women and children surrounding him, believing him to be their divinely appointed chief and leader.\n\nHowever, as he gazed towards the north, the memory of the men from whom they had escaped tainted the beauty of the sea and sky.\n\nThere was no immediate threat from the men who had taken control of Palm Tree, as they lacked canoes. However, they would undoubtedly build them, and they would inevitably see the reflection of the Karolin lagoon in the sky, just as he had. They would come, perhaps after a significant delay.\n\nDick, although largely assimilated into the local culture, retained the capacity for abstract thought and foresight.\n\nThat morning, he had dispatched a canoe to the southern beach to fetch Aioma, Palia, and Tafata, three elderly men, too old for warfare, but skilled canoe builders. He noted with satisfaction that nearly a hundred youths were approaching war age. Yet, underlying all of this strategic thinking, fueling his courage, was his deep affection for Katafa, his most cherished companion, now potentially threatened.\n\nWar canoes. Was his intention to defend the lagoon or the shore against invaders, or did he vaguely intend to be the attacker, destroying the danger at its source before it could develop? Only time would tell.\n\nA hand rested on his shoulder. Turning, he faced Katafa, a strand of her dark hair escaping from the vine thread binding it, blowing like an eagle's feather in the breeze. Her luminous, dark eyes were fixed on the northern horizon.\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d Katafa exclaimed.\n\nUnder certain weather conditions, Palm Tree, despite its distance, became visible from Karolin through mirage. They had seen it the previous evening, and now it was beginning to emerge again, a mysterious stain low in the southern sky, a dull spot in the dazzling sea, gradually deepening and solidifying until the island appeared, vividly sketched by an unseen hand.\n\nWith her hand on his shoulder, they stood in silence, their minds untutored in the science of mirage, their eyes fixed on the place from which they had escaped, now strangely rising beyond the horizon as if observing them.\n\nThey relived the sight of the horde of savages on the beach, figures monstrous as nightmares. They felt the wind filling the sail as the dinghy raced for safety on the open sea, and heard the yells of the Melanesians, crazed with rum stolen from the schooner they had burned. The scene of their near tragedy lay before them, a beautiful picture that concealed the demons still residing there.\n\nAs Dick gazed at this beauty, which was simultaneously a threat and a warning, his nostrils flared and his eyes darkened with hatred. They had threatened him, which was inconsequential, but they had threatened Katafa, which was everything. And they still threatened her.\n\nSomeday they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to echo his instincts. They would build canoes, see the lagoon light in the sky, and come. They were without women, and here were women. Instinct whispered that, just as he had been drawn to Katafa, so would these men be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon for an island to raid for women, and upon seeing the lagoon light, they would come.\n\nIf he had known, danger lay not only to the north, but wherever greed, desire, or hatred might roam on that azure sea, not only amongst savages, but the wolves of civilization.\n\nTo Dick, the world was confined to the waters surrounding the two islands. He knew nothing of Europe, America, or history, except for the history of his short life and Katafa's. Yet, even within that limited experience, he had learned to fear men and had recognized the basis of all history: man's instinct for war, rapine, and destruction.\n\nThen, gradually, the vision of Palm Tree began to fade and disappear, suddenly vanishing like an extinguished light. As they turned from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the southern beach.\n\nIt was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they walked down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.\n",

Dick, followed by Katafa, approached the landing, placing a hand on the mast stays attached to the outrigger gratings. He addressed the women, who had disembarked and now stood, paddles in hand, their gaze shifting between him and Katafa.\n\n\u201cAnd the builders?\u201d he inquired. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d\n\nThe shorter woman made a dismissive sound with her tongue and averted her face towards the lagoon. The taller woman met Dick's gaze directly.\n\n\u201cThey will not come,\u201d she stated. \u201cThey claim Uta Matu was their only king, and he is dead. Furthermore, they cite their advanced age as a hindrance. They are 'a mataya ayana'\u2014feeble and nearing the end of their fishing days, even in calm waters.\u201d\n\nThe shorter woman stifled a sound that resembled a laugh before turning squarely to Dick.\n\n\u201cThey will not come, Taori. All else is mere words.\u201d\n\nHer assessment proved accurate. Despite receiving a direct order to cross over, they refused, unwilling to acknowledge the newcomer as their chief. This unwillingness was the core of the matter.\n\nAs the canoe beached, several villagers, drawn by the sight, gathered and listened. The subject was already under hushed discussion within the growing group. Dick, his foot resting on the tilted outrigger, focused his attention on the sennit binding of the outrigger pole, appearing lost in profound study.\n\nThe initial surge of anger upon hearing the news had subsided, replaced by thoughtful consideration.\n\nThis was not a trivial matter. While lacking familiarity with the explicit concepts of \u201crevolt\u201d and \u201cauthority,\u201d Dick understood the implications. The sole individuals capable of directing the construction of large war canoes were refusing to work. He recognized, based on the women\u2019s tone and demeanor, that a failure to compel the canoe-builders\u2019 compliance would erode his ability to influence the natives.\n\nDick was not prone to prolonged deliberation. Turning from the canoe, he swiftly retrieved a fish spear from the house where the model ships were carefully stored. He then called to the women, assisted in launching the canoe, boarded, and helped raise the mat sail to catch the wind from the break.\n\n\u201cI will return shortly,\u201d he announced to Katafa, his voice carried across the water by the wind. The women crouched down to provide ballast, and Dick took the steering paddle in hand.\n\nThe canoe that had carried Katafa to Palm Tree years ago had been Dick's first exposure to South Sea island craft. Its allure remained with him. This canoe was larger, with a broader beam. The long, skate-shaped outrigger was connected to the main body not by poles, but by a bridge.\n\nAs he steered, Dick observed every detail: the rattan of the grating, the method of fixing the mast stays to the grating, the mast\u2019s stepping, the outrigger and the curve of its ends, the mat sail and its attachment to the yard.\n\nDespite his lack of prior experience steering such a vessel, his innate understanding of seafaring allowed him to navigate effectively. The watching women detected no hesitation or uncertainty in his movements.\n\nThere are two primary ways to capsize this type of canoe through improper handling: allowing the outrigger to rise too high out of the water, or allowing it to dip too deep. Dick seemed to possess this knowledge instinctively, avoiding both dangers as they crossed the swells coming in from the break.\n\nThe beach where the remaining members of the southern tribe resided was located directly opposite the beach of the northern tribe, and both were close to the break in the reef, making the distance between them just over a mile. As they approached, Dick could distinguish the remaining huts nestled under a grove of jackfruit trees. Beyond the jackfruit stood pandanus palms leaning towards the lagoon, and three tall coconut palms silhouetted against the horizon.\n\nAs the canoe beached, Dick saw the rebels. They sat on the sand near the easternmost hut, shaded by the jackfruit leaves. Three old men sat, two with their knees drawn up, and one cross-legged. A young girl lay nearby, close to a small pool.\n\nAs Dick approached, accompanied by the taller of the two women, the girl, who had been gazing into the pool, looked up.\n\nShe was Le Moan, granddaughter of Le Juan, the deceased witch woman of Karolin. Le Moan, only fourteen years old, had heard of the new ruler\u2019s arrival, along with Katafa, the girl once believed dead. She knew that her grandfather, Aioma, had been ordered to the northern beach to build canoes for the new chief, and she had witnessed the old man's refusal. Le Moan had wondered about the nature of this new chief. The imposing figure of Uta Matu, the last king of Karolin, had been evoked by the word \u201cchief,\u201d and now, as the canoe was hauled up and the women announced, \"He comes,\" she saw Dick.\n\nDick, with the sun illuminating his face and red-gold hair, Dick, naked and honey-colored, lithe as a panther and straight as a spear. Dick, with his eyes fixed on the three old men of Karolin, who had turned to observe him.\n\nLe Moan gasped, then seemed to hold her breath as the vision approached, passed her silently, and stood facing Aioma, the eldest and most skilled of the canoe-builders.\n\nDespite her youth, Le Moan was nearly as tall as Katafa. She was not a true Polynesian; her mother had been a native of Karolin, but her father, a sailor from a Spanish ship destroyed years ago by Uta Matu, had imparted European characteristics so distinct that she stood apart from the other islanders, like a pine among palm trees.\n\nShe possessed a burgeoning dark beauty and an enigmatic quality akin to the depths of the sea. Sometimes, seated alone beneath the towering jackfruit trees, she would tilt her head as if listening, as if a distant voice were calling through the sound of the surf, its words just beyond her grasp. At other times, she would sit above the reef pools, gazing into the crystal water teeming with coral and fish, yet seemingly perceiving something more.\n\nThe intermingling of two vastly different races sometimes produces peculiar results. It was as if Le Moan was occasionally overwhelmed by ancestral voices or visions from distant lands.\n\nWhen she accompanied Aioma fishing, Aioma never feared losing sight of land, for Le Moan possessed an uncanny ability to navigate.\n\nShe could find her way on foot even when blindfolded on the coral, and she could return from beyond the sea-line with the unerring accuracy of a homing pigeon, possessing an innate compass in her mind.\n\nThis was the sole gift she had inherited from her mother, La Jennabon, who in turn had received it from seafaring ancestors in the remote past.\n\nCrouching by the pool, she observed Dick standing before Aioma and heard his voice.\n\n\"You are Aioma?\" Dick asked, having instinctively singled out the leader of the three.\n\nThe old men rose. The sight of the newcomer was impressive, but it was the successful identification of Aioma by someone who had never seen him that truly struck them. Surely, this was a chief.\n\n\"I am Aioma,\" he replied. \"What do you want with me?\"\n\n\"That which the woman has already told you,\" Dick responded, disliking repetition or wasted words.\n\n\"They spoke of a new chief who had come to the northern beach\u2014e uma kaio tau\u2014and had ordered canoes to be built,\" Aioma said. \"I replied, 'I am too old, and Uta is dead, and I recognize no chief but Uta. Moreover, in the last war on the northern island, all the men of Karolin perished, and neither they nor their canoes have returned. So what is the purpose of building more canoes when there are no men to crew them?'\"\n\n\"The men are growing,\" Dick countered.\n\n\"Indeed, they are growing,\" Aioma grumbled, \"but many moons will pass before they can wield a paddle and spear. And even then, where is the enemy? The sea is clear.\"\n\n\"Aioma,\" Dick said, pointing to the north, \"I have come from there. The sea is not clear.\"\n\n\"You have come from Marua (Palm Tree)?\"\n\n\"I have come from Marua, where Katafa arrived, carried by the wind in her canoe. We lived there until men landed, killing, breaking, and burning\u2014even the large canoe they arrived in. Then Katafa and I set sail for Karolin, for Karolin called me to rule her people.\"\n\n\"And the men who landed to kill and burn?\" Aioma inquired.\n\n\"They remain on Marua. They lack canoes, but they will build them, and they will surely come.\"\n\nNeither of Aioma's companions spoke. Aioma stood looking at the ground as if seeking counsel, then raised his eyes to Dick\u2019s face. Age and war had made Aioma wise. He recognized men, and he recognized Truth when he saw her.\n\n\u201cI will do your bidding, Taori,\" he said simply. He turned to the others, issuing instructions for their actions until his return, and led the way to the canoe.\n\nLe Moan, still crouching by the pool, remained silent. Her eyes were fixed on Dick, this being so novel, so different from anyone she had ever encountered. Perhaps her racial instincts were telling her that this was a member of her father\u2019s race, miraculously arrived in Karolin. Perhaps she was simply captivated by the newcomer's grace and youth.\n\nAs Dick turned, he fully noticed her for the first time. Their eyes met, and he paused, captivated by her gaze and her unique appearance, so unlike that of the other natives. For a moment, his mind seemed ensnared, then he averted his eyes, pushed off, and filled the canoe's sail with the wind from the reef break.\n\nLe Moan, rising and shielding her eyes, stood watching the sail shrink across the sparkling water, watching the canoe rise and fall on the swell from the break, watching it reach the distant white line of the northern beach, where Katafa awaited the return of her lover.\n",

Dick, followed by Katafa, approached. He placed a hand on the mast stays connected to the outrigger gratings and addressed the women, who had disembarked and stood with paddles in hand, their gazes shifting between him and Katafa.\n\n\"Where are the builders?\" he inquired.\n\nThe shorter woman made a clicking sound with her tongue and averted her gaze toward the lagoon.

This canoe was larger, broader in beam, and the long, skate-shaped outrigger was connected by a bridge rather than poles.\n\nAs he steered, Dick absorbed every detail: the rattan of the grating, the mast stays, the mast's placement, the outrigger's curve, the mat sail's attachment to the yard.\n\nAlthough he had never steered a canoe before, his innate seacraft skills guided him. The women, observing intently, detected no uncertainty in his movements.\n\nThere are two potential ways to capsize a canoe of this type through mishandling: either allowing the outrigger to rise too high out of the water or allowing it to dip too deeply.\n\nDick seemed to instinctively understand this, and as they navigated the incoming waves from the reef break, he avoided both perils.\n\nThe beach occupied by the remnants of the southern tribe was directly opposite the northern tribe's beach. Given their proximity to the break, the distance between them was just over a mile. As they approached, Dick could discern the few remaining huts sheltered by a grove of jackfruit trees. Beyond the jackfruit stood pandanus palms leaning lagoonward, and three tall coconut palms silhouetted against the horizon.\n\nAs the canoe beached, Dick saw the defiant elders seated on the sand near the easternmost hut, in the shade of the jackfruit trees. Three old men sat, two with knees drawn up and one cross-legged. Nearby, a girl lay beside a small pool.\n\nAs Dick drew near, accompanied by the taller of the boat women, the girl, who had been gazing into the pool, looked up.\n\nShe was Le Moan, granddaughter of Le Juan, the deceased witch woman of Karolin, facing judgment for her destructive actions. Le Moan was only fourteen years old. She had heard of the new ruler's arrival in Karolin, accompanied by Katafa, the girl long presumed dead. She had heard the order given to her grandfather Aioma that morning to report to the northern beach, as the new chief required canoes to be built. She had also heard the old man's refusal. Le Moan had wondered about the new chief. The imposing figure of Uta Matu, Karolin's last king, had come to mind. Now, as the canoe was hauled up and the women exclaimed, \"He comes,\" she saw Dick.\n\nDick, his face and red-gold hair illuminated by the sun, Dick, naked and honey-colored, as lithe as a panther and as straight as a spear. Dick, his eyes fixed on the three old men of Karolin, who had turned to observe him.\n\nLe Moan inhaled sharply, then seemed to cease breathing as the vision approached, passed her without a word, and stood before Aioma, the eldest and most accomplished of the canoe builders.\n\nLe Moan, though only fourteen, was nearly as tall as Katafa. She was not a true Polynesian; although her mother was a native of Karolin, her father, a sailor from a Spanish ship destroyed years ago by Uta Matu, had imparted European characteristics so pronounced that she stood apart from the other islanders.\n\nShe possessed a dark beauty just beginning to unfold, and she was as enigmatic as the ocean depths themselves. At times, seated alone beneath the towering jackfruits, she would tilt her head as if listening, as if some voice were calling through the sound of the surf, a voice whose words she could not quite decipher. At other times, she would sit above the reef pools, gazing deep into the crystal waters where coral bloomed and fish swam, but where she seemed to perceive more than mere marine life.\n\nThe fusion of two disparate races sometimes produces peculiar results. It was almost as if Le Moan were troubled by voices or visions from distant ancestral lands.\n\nShe would accompany Aioma fishing, and with her aboard, Aioma never feared losing sight of land, for Le Moan possessed the ability to find her way.\n\nBlindfolded on the coral, she could navigate on foot. Taken beyond the sea line, she would return like a homing pigeon. She seemed to possess an innate compass.\n\nThis was the only gift she had inherited from her mother, La Jennabon, who had received it from seafaring ancestors of the remote past.\n\nCrouching by the pool, she now saw Dick standing before Aioma, and she heard his voice.\n\n\"Are you Aioma?\" Dick asked, singling out the chief of the three by intuition.\n\nThe three old men rose. The sight of the newcomer was impactful, but the act of singling out Aioma with such accuracy by one who had never seen him was especially compelling. Surely, this was a leader.\n\n\"I am Aioma,\" the other replied. \"What do you seek from me?\"\n\n\"That which the woman has already conveyed,\" Dick responded, disliking repetition.\n\n\"They spoke of the new chief who has arrived at the northern beach\u2014e uma kaio tau\u2014and of his order to build canoes,\" Aioma said. \"I replied, 'I am too old, and Uta is dead, and I acknowledge no chief but Uta. Moreover, in the last war on that island to the north, all the men of Karolin perished, and neither they nor their canoes have ever returned.' Therefore, what is the purpose of building more canoes when there are no men to crew them?\"\n\n\"The men are growing,\" Dick countered.\n\n\"Indeed, they are growing,\" Aioma grumbled, \"but it will be many moons before they can wield the paddle and the spear. And even then, where is the enemy? The sea is tranquil.\"\n\n\"Aioma,\" Dick said, \"I have come from there,\" indicating the north. \"The sea is not tranquil.\"\n\n\"You have come from Marua (Palm Tree)?\"\n\n\"I have come from Marua, where Katafa arrived, carried by the wind from here in her canoe. There we lived until recently, when men landed, killing, destroying, and burning\u2014even the large canoe they arrived in. Katafa and I set sail for Karolin, for Karolin called me to lead its people.\"\n\n\"And the men who landed to kill and burn?\" Aioma asked.\n\n\"They remain on Marua. They lack canoes but will construct them, and they will inevitably come.\"\n\nNeither of Aioma's companions spoke. Aioma looked at the ground as if consulting it, then his eyes met Dick's. Experience had made Aioma wise. He knew men and recognized truth when he encountered it.\n\n\"I will obey your command, Taori,\" he said simply. He turned to the others, issuing instructions, and led the way to the canoe.\n\nLe Moan, still crouching by the pool, remained silent. Her eyes were fixed on Dick, this being so new and distinct from anyone she had known. Perhaps ancestral memory told her that here was a being of her father's race miraculously arrived in Karolin, or perhaps she was simply captivated by the newcomer's youth and grace.\n\nAs Dick turned, he noticed her fully for the first time. Their eyes met, and he paused, captivated by her gaze and her singular appearance. For a moment, his mind seemed ensnared. Then, lowering his gaze, he proceeded to the steering paddle, pushed off, and the wind filled the canoe's sail.\n\nLe Moan, rising and shielding her eyes, watched as the sail diminished across the water, as the canoe rose and fell on the swell, as it reached the white line of the northern beach where Katafa awaited her lover's return.\n",

Dick and Katafa approached. Dick rested a hand on the mast stays connected to the outrigger supports and addressed the women, who stood holding their paddles, their eyes moving between him and Katafa.\n\n\"Where are the builders?\" he asked.\n\nThe shorter woman clicked her tongue and looked toward the lagoon. The taller woman met Dick's gaze.\n\n\"They refuse to come,\" she said. \"They claim Uta Matu was their only king and he is dead. They also say they are too old\u2014'A mataya ayana'\u2014weakened and barely able to fish, even in calm waters.\"\n\nThe shorter woman stifled a laugh and turned to Dick.\n\n\"They will not come, Taori. Words are useless.\"\n\nShe was right. Despite the clear order to come, they refused to acknowledge Dick as their chief, using age and Uta Matu's death as excuses.\n\nVillagers, drawn by the canoe's arrival, gathered and listened. Whispers spread through the group near the canoe. Dick, his foot on the tilted outrigger, seemed absorbed in the sennit binding of the outrigger pole.\n\nHis initial anger subsided, replaced by focused thought.\n\nThis was significant. Though unfamiliar with the concepts of \"revolt\" and \"authority,\" Dick understood abstractly. The only men capable of building large war canoes were refusing. The women's demeanor suggested that unless this defiance was addressed, his influence over the natives would be compromised.\n\nDick acted decisively. Turning from the canoe, he hurried to the house where he kept his model ships, returning with a fish spear.\n\nHe called the women to help, launched the canoe, boarded, and raised the sail to catch the wind from the break.\n\n\"I will return shortly,\" he called to Katafa, his voice carried on the wind. The women crouched to balance the canoe as he took the steering paddle.\n\nThe canoe that brought Katafa to Palm Tree was the first South Sea craft he'd seen and had captivated him. This one was larger, broader, with a skate-shaped outrigger connected by a bridge.\n\nAs he steered, Dick absorbed every detail: the rattan grating, mast stays, mast placement, outrigger curve, and sail attachment.\n\nThough inexperienced, his innate seacraft guided him. The women saw no hesitation in his actions.\n\nA canoe like this could capsize if the outrigger lifted too high or dipped too low.\n\nDick seemed to understand instinctively, avoiding both dangers as they navigated the waves from the reef break.\n\nThe southern tribe's beach was directly opposite the northern one. Being near the break, the distance was just over a mile. Approaching, Dick saw the remaining huts sheltered by jackfruit trees. Beyond them, pandanus palms leaned toward the lagoon, and three coconut palms stood silhouetted.\n\nAs the canoe beached, Dick saw the defiant elders seated on the sand near the easternmost hut, shaded by the jackfruit trees. Three old men sat, two with knees drawn up and one cross-legged.

Only fourteen, she'd heard of the new ruler and Katafa's return. She knew of the order given to her grandfather Aioma that morning and his refusal. She wondered about the new chief, imagining Uta Matu. Now, as the canoe was hauled up and the women announced, \"He comes,\" she saw Dick.\n\nDick, sunlit, red-gold-haired, naked, honey-colored, lithe as a panther, straight as a spear. His eyes fixed on the three old men, who turned to look at him.\n\nLe Moan inhaled, then held her breath as he approached, passed her silently, and stood before Aioma, the eldest and most skilled canoe builder.\n\nThough only fourteen, Le Moan was almost as tall as Katafa. She wasn't fully Polynesian. Her mother was native, but her father, a sailor from a Spanish ship destroyed by Uta Matu, gave her distinct European features.\n\nHer dark beauty was unfolding, and she was enigmatic. Sometimes, she tilted her head beneath the jackfruits, listening for a voice in the surf, words she couldn't decipher. Other times, she gazed into reef pools, seeming to see more than marine life.\n\nThe mixing of races sometimes creates unusual results, as if Le Moan were troubled by ancestral voices or visions.\n\nShe fished with Aioma, and with her aboard, he never feared losing sight of land, for she had an innate sense of direction.\n\nBlindfolded, she navigated the coral. Taken beyond sight of land, she returned like a homing pigeon, possessing an inner compass.\n\nThis was her only inheritance from her mother, La Jennabon, passed down from seafaring ancestors.\n\nCrouching by the pool, she saw Dick before Aioma and heard his voice.\n\n\"Are you Aioma?\" Dick asked, identifying the chief by intuition.\n\nThe old men rose. The newcomer's presence impressed them, but his accurate identification of Aioma was particularly compelling. He was clearly a leader.\n\n\"I am Aioma,\" he replied. \"What do you want from me?\"\n\n\"What the woman conveyed,\" Dick said, disliking repetition.\n\n\"They spoke of the new chief\u2014e uma kaio tau\u2014and his order to build canoes,\" Aioma said. \"I replied, 'I am too old. Uta is dead, and I acknowledge no chief but Uta. In the last war, all Karolin's men perished in the north, and neither they nor their canoes returned.' Why build more canoes when there are no men?\"\n\n\"The men are growing,\" Dick countered.\n\n\"Growing,\" Aioma grumbled, \"but many moons before they can wield paddle and spear. And where is the enemy? The sea is calm.\"\n\n\"Aioma,\" Dick said, \"I came from there,\" indicating north. \"The sea is not calm.\"\n\n\"You came from Marua (Palm Tree)?\"\n\n\"From Marua, where Katafa arrived, carried by the wind. We lived there until men landed, killing, destroying, burning\u2014even their own canoe. Katafa and I sailed for Karolin, called to lead its people.\"\n\n\"And the men who landed?\" Aioma asked.\n\n\"They remain on Marua. They lack canoes but will build them, and they will come.\"\n\nAioma's companions were silent. Aioma looked down, then met Dick's eyes. Experience had made him wise; he recognized truth.\n\n\"I will obey your command, Taori,\" he said simply, turned to the others, gave instructions, and led toward the canoe.\n\nLe Moan, crouching by the pool, remained silent, her eyes fixed on Dick, so new and distinct.

Then, looking down, he took the steering paddle, pushed off, and the wind filled the sail.\n\nLe Moan, rising and shielding her eyes, watched as the sail diminished, as the canoe rose and fell on the swell, reaching the northern beach where Katafa awaited her lover.\n```",
